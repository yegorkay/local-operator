"""The non-blocking recorder: turns a call into a queued sample, off the loop.

This is the one object the rest of the harness touches. A session's stream
wrapper builds a :class:`CallSnapshot` on the event loop (cheap, see
``model.snapshot_component_chars``) and hands it to :func:`record_call`; that
call does a single ``queue.put_nowait`` and returns. A background daemon thread
drains the queue in batches and writes them to the shared SQLite store.

Why a thread and not an asyncio task. The write is blocking SQLite I/O, and the
sessions that produce samples run on the event loop that must never block on
disk. A daemon thread also survives across the many short-lived event loops a
process opens (each subagent run, each reload) without being re-created, and it
is shared by every session in the process, so N sessions still write through
one queue and one connection.

Why best-effort with a bounded queue. Accuracy matters, but never at the cost
of a stalled session. The queue is large enough that a normal burst never
fills it, and if it somehow does the sample is DROPPED (counted, logged once)
rather than applying back-pressure to a provider call. On a healthy machine the
drop count stays zero; when it does not, the log says analytics is losing
samples rather than the session mysteriously slowing down.

Why retention has ONE owner per host, elected on the config root. Every ``lop``
process that records a call builds a recorder, and each recorder prunes the
retention window on its own hourly timer -- so on a host with 18-22 live
processes holding one shared ``analytics.db`` there were 18-22 hourly sweeps
over the same ledger, each one paying for a backlog delete and its WAL churn.
The sweep is elected instead: the recorders race for a non-blocking ``flock``
on ``<config root>/run/analytics-maintenance.lock``, the winner runs the sweep
and stamps the hour into that file, and every loser skips it. See
:meth:`AnalyticsRecorder._run_owned_maintenance` for the mechanism and why it
cannot block the loop or a session.

        1. an explicit ``maintenance_root`` (tests);
        2. the DIRECTORY OF THE STORE'S OWN DATABASE. For the process default
           that is ``config_dir() / "analytics.db"``, so the root is the
           resolved config root — and for a store pointed anywhere else (a

           the store instead of landing in the operator's root;
        3. :func:`local_operator.paths.config_dir`, for a store that cannot name
           its database (a stub), so the behaviour is still the documented one.

        WHAT THIS FUNCTION IS CAREFUL ABOUT. It resolves the root the same way
        every other per-root thing here does — through ``config_dir()``, which
        honours ``LOCAL_OPERATOR_CONFIG_DIR`` — and it NEVER keys on
        ``Path.home()``. That distinction is not theoretical: the browser
        bridge's supervisor label was derived from ``Path.home()`` while its
        launchd domain was not, so an isolated run registered the GLOBAL label
        and evicted the operator's live daemon (see AGENTS.md, "Isolating a run";
        #1310 is the same class of mistake). An isolated run must elect within
        its own root and must not touch the operator's store, so the root here
        is always a RESOLVED root and never a home shortcut — ``config_dir()``
        itself falls back to ``~/.local-operator`` only when there is no

        """Elect an owner for this hour's sweep, and sweep if it is us.

        Runs on the writer thread. Returns True when THIS call swept.

        THE MECHANISM, in three steps:

        1. Take ``<root>/run/analytics-maintenance.lock`` with
           ``LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB``. A loser returns here and does nothing else:
           no polling, no waiting, no sweep. The lock is held for the duration
           of the sweep only, so a process that is killed mid-sweep releases it
           with its descriptor.
        2. Read the hour stamped in the file. The winner of the LOCK is not
           automatically the owner of the HOUR: with this lock alone, process A
           would sweep, release, and process B — whose own hourly timer fires
           two minutes later — would take the free lock and sweep again, which
           is the 18-22-sweeps-an-hour problem wearing a different hat. The
           stamp is what makes ownership survive the winner's exit: a claim
           younger than ``_PRUNE_INTERVAL_S`` means this hour is already done
           and the caller skips it.
        3. Sweep, then stamp. The stamp is written only after the sweep
           returned, so a sweep that failed is not recorded as done and the next
           process to come due will retry it.

        WHY A LOCK AT ALL, GIVEN THAT THE SWEEP IS IDEMPOTENT. The claim in the
        file is a scheduling datum, and the two steps around it (read, decide,
        write) are a read-modify-write that must not interleave — that is all
        the lock protects. ``prune()`` is idempotent and needs no mutual
        exclusion to be CORRECT, so nothing of value crosses this lock: no
        capability, no token, no secret, and no authority over any other
        process. That is deliberate, and it is what keeps this out of the
        same-uid impostor class the secret broker's own lock is careful about
        (#1310): an attacker who takes this lock can only make analytics
        maintenance happen LATER, and every participant is a recorder of the
        operator's own uid doing the operator's own retention sweep. A lock that
        carried a capability would need the broker's peer authentication; this
        one does not, and must not grow one.

        WHY THIS CANNOT FREEZE ANYTHING. Every syscall here is bounded and none
        of them is on the event loop:

        * the lock is ``LOCK_NB`` and there is NO poll loop, so a wedged holder
          costs a loser one refused ``flock``;
        * the claim read/write is a bounded ``pread``/``write`` of 64 bytes on
          the descriptor already held;
        * the sweep itself (``store.prune`` and ``store.bound_wal``) is SQLite
          I/O on the writer thread, and the WAL half is shaped so that it can
          never wait for a reader (see ``AnalyticsStore.bound_wal``).

        So a session's provider path — which only ever does a ``put_nowait``
        on the queue — is untouched by any of it, whatever another process is
        doing under the lock.

        write happened.

        It did not mean that before #1250 item 2. The old body waited on a
        commit count that only call snapshots advanced, then polled
        ``queue.empty()`` and slept a flat 50 ms — three separate holes:

        * the queue empties the moment the writer DEQUEUES, so an item in the
          writer's hands passed the empty check; and the queued items it did
          see were counted as settled by the 50 ms sleep, not by a write;
        * an item carrying no snapshot — a session name, a tool call — never
          moved a counter at all, so the barrier never waited on it;
        * on expiry it returned as if it had succeeded.

        That is why ``tests/unit/evaluation/runner/test_provider_client.py``
        could read a ``session_names`` row the writer had not committed yet.

        The barrier is the queue's own completion count: the writer calls
        ``task_done()`` for an item only after the ``_flush`` carrying it has
        returned, so returning means every item enqueued before now has been
        through ``_flush``, names and tool calls included. That is a statement
        about the write PATH, not about the row: the writer's store calls are
        fail-soft (a bad sample must never kill the writer or stall a session),
        so an item whose write was LOST settles like any other. A lost write is
        reported two ways — the store raised, or it returned a drop (the real
        ``AnalyticsStore`` never raises on a lost lock: it retries, gives up and
        returns 0 rows / ``False``) — and the writer counts both. This method
        raises on any it has not already reported, so it cannot return clean
        while the row a caller is about to read is missing, which is the failure
        mode this whole method exists to remove.

        ON EXPIRY OR A LOST WRITE THIS RAISES rather than returning. A caller
        that asked for a guarantee must get either the guarantee or a failure
        naming what went wrong. The write-loss report names only the failures
        since the previous report, so its counts are new losses rather than a
