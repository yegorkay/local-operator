"""SQLite-backed, parallel-safe store for token-consumption analytics.

Shape of the data. Every provider call across every ``lop`` session appends
one row to ``calls``. That table is the raw ledger; it is bounded by a rolling
retention window (old rows are pruned) so a machine that runs for months does
not accumulate an unbounded database. A per-call row is small — a dozen
integers and two short strings — so even a busy week is a few megabytes.

Why one shared database and not per-session files. Several sessions run at
once (one per cmux workspace), and the whole point of the feature is a
*universal* view. WAL mode plus a busy timeout makes concurrent writes from
different processes atomic and serialised by SQLite itself — the same
discipline ``providers/usage_cache.py`` and ``auth.db`` already rely on — so
"parallel safe" is a property of the engine, not something this module has to
reinvent with file locks.

Why aggregation is a query, not a running counter. Keeping live totals would
mean a read-modify-write on every call and a lock contended by every session.
Instead each call is an append (no contention beyond the WAL) and the
``/analytics`` screen reads a GROUP BY when it opens. That GROUP BY is over the
maintained ``session_daily`` rollup rather than the raw ledger, because the
ledger stopped being bounded in practice. THE NUMBERS BELOW ARE THE RECORDED
ONES — ``bench/analytics-rollup-before.json`` / ``-after.json``, produced by
``scripts/bench_panel_latency.py`` against a copy of that ledger, p50 — and they
are the only set any comment or document should quote; a second sample of the
same code is not a second opinion, it is a second measurement. That pair left the
tree with the rest of ``bench/`` (AGENTS.md, "Evidence goes on the PR, never into
the repository") and is quoted from ``ba225070``, the ``main`` this sweep branched
from, where the whole store is still present:
``git show ba225070:bench/analytics-rollup-after.json``.
On the operator's 342.8 MB, 1 155 845 call ledger the panel's 30-day window costs
4 868 ms wall / 3 179 ms CPU on the raw ledger (2 764 ms / 2 134 ms CPU for the
first read of a fresh copy), while the rollup answers the same window in 187 ms
wall / 166 ms CPU. Both arms were measured in ONE session at load ~215-280 on a
shared 14-core host under a RAM hold, and that matters more than it looks: CPU is
MORE portable than wall but not immune to this box's memory pressure (the same
fast path measured 121 ms of CPU at load 38 and 166 ms at load 237), so a
recorded pair is only meaningful read as a pair, with its load. The ratio — 19x
of CPU, 26x of wall — is the durable part. The raw-ledger query is still there,
unchanged, behind a fail-closed gate that answers whenever the rollup cannot prove
the same numbers (``aggregate()``'s docstring has the account).

Failures never interrupt a session: a store that cannot open is a no-op
recorder. Aggregate reads retain their empty fallback; the current-session
diagnostic additionally distinguishes an unavailable ledger from zero usage.

#: the same patience ``_WRITE_RETRIES`` exists to work within, and it is what a
#: blocked ``wal_checkpoint`` waits out (measured: 5.183 s) — see
#: ``bound_wal``, whose whole shape is about never paying that on the writer
#: thread.
_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000

#: HOW BIG A WAL FILE MAY BE LEFT ON DISK. 16 MiB, and the reasoning is a
#: measurement rather than a round number.
#:
#: WHAT IT BOUNDS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT -- BOTH HALVES MATTER, because the
#: obvious reading of this pragma is wrong. ``journal_size_limit`` is applied at
#: a WAL RESTART: "each time a transaction is committed or a WAL file resets,
#: SQLite compares the size of the ... WAL file left in the file-system to the
#: size limit ... and if [it] is larger it is truncated to the limit" (SQLite
#: pragma docs). Two consequences, both measured on sqlite 3.50.4 in
#: ``.perf/bench/lane2``:
#:
#: * It does NOT shrink a WAL that is already large. A 24,781,832 byte file
#:   stayed at 24,781,832 with this limit, with a 4 MiB limit and with the
#:   default -1; a checkpoint that backfilled every frame left it at 24,781,832
#:   too (a PASSIVE/FULL checkpoint reclaims space INSIDE the file, not the file
#:   itself). Only a TRUNCATE checkpoint, or a restart AFTER a complete
#:   checkpoint, takes the bytes back. So this pragma is not the fix for the
#:   528 MB WAL measured below, and nothing here should claim it is:
#:   :meth:`bound_wal` is the reclaim, and this is the bound on what grows back.
#: * It DOES bound what a restart leaves behind. When the same oversized WAL was
#:   restarted by a connection carrying the limit, the file became exactly
#:   16,777,216 bytes with this value, 4,194,304 with a 4 MiB one, and 4,152
#:   (one frame) with 0. The default -1 leaves the high-water mark forever, which
#:   is precisely the live failure: 528,204,632 bytes -- 128,956 pages, 129x
#:   SQLite's 1000-page auto-checkpoint threshold -- against a 659 MB database,
#:   unchanged across two samples 20 s apart. A file that big is not a working
#:   set; it is space nothing will ever give back.
#:
#: WHY 16 MiB. Three constraints, in order: it must be comfortably ABOVE the
#: 1000-page auto-checkpoint threshold (4 MiB at the 4 KiB page size this
#: database uses), because a limit below the working set turns every restart into
#: a truncate-then-regrow cycle -- the limit=0 shape; it must be SMALL against
#: the ledger it belongs to, so the retained file is a rounding error rather than
#: a second copy of the data (16 MiB is 2.4% of the 659 MB database above); and
#: it must hold several checkpoint cycles' frames, so a restart leaves a file the
#: next writes REUSE instead of one they must extend. 16 MiB is 4 auto-checkpoint
#: cycles, and the two bounds it sits between are 4 MiB and 659 MB.
#:
#: WHY NOT 0. Zero is the "always truncate to the minimum" setting: measured, the
#: same 24.8 MB restart left 4,152 bytes instead of 4,194,304. It gives up the
#: whole reuse window to save at most the 16 MiB this constant already caps --
#: 2.4% of this ledger -- and pays for it on the write path, where each restart
#: re-extends the file under the write lock instead of writing into space that is
#: already there. That write-path cost was NOT measurable here (40 forced restart
#: cycles, 156 MB written: 1.003 s of CPU at limit 0, 0.959 s at 16 MiB, 0.962 s
#: at -1, with identical 3.96 MB peak WALs -- inside run-to-run noise), which is
#: why the tie goes to the bound that keeps the reuse window: the headroom is
#: free, and the space it costs is bounded by the constant itself. What is being
#: bought is 528 MB of never-reclaimed file becoming at most 16 MB.
#:
#: PER CONNECTION, WHICH IS WHY IT IS SET IN TWO PLACES. The limit belongs to the
#: connection that PERFORMS the restart, not to the database file: measured, a
#: limit set on connection A did not truncate a WAL restarted by connection B
#: (24,790,072 stayed 24,790,072), while the same 4 MiB limit truncated when A
#: set it and A restarted. ``_connect`` therefore sets it on every connection
#: this module opens -- every analytics process, whether or not it ever wins the
#: maintenance election -- and ``bound_wal`` re-asserts it on the writer's
#: connection at the sweep, immediately before the truncate that reclaims.
_WAL_SIZE_LIMIT_BYTES = 16 * 1024 * 1024

#: Precedence of a name written to ``session_names``, mirroring the rules
#: ``session/naming.py`` documents for the live ``ConversationName`` holder.
#: Higher wins; equal replaces (a re-title must be able to replace the title it
#: supersedes). The gate lives in the SQL of ``upsert_session_name`` rather than
#: in each caller, because the callers run on three different threads and in two
#: different processes — several ``lop`` sessions share this file — so a
#: read-then-write check in Python would be a race by construction.
#:
#: ``PROVISIONAL`` is the opener-derived stand-in the TUI already paints on the
#: status band the instant a message is submitted. It is deliberately BELOW a
#: real title: it quotes the question rather than answering it, and it exists so
#: that a session whose naming call never lands still reads as something a human
#: recognises instead of a bare 12-hex id.
#:
#: ``BACKFILL`` sits at the same level as ``PROVISIONAL`` and not higher,
#: despite often recovering a genuine journalled title: the sweep cannot tell
#: from disk whether what it found was user-set, so ranking it above a live
#: title would let a startup sweep overwrite a rename that had not yet been

--   by_session    GROUP BY session_id, with MAX(parent_session_id)
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. ``aggregate()`` used to be three full scans of ``calls`` with
-- a non-covering index range scan, so every one of the ledger's 1.16 M rows cost
-- a random table lookup: the recorded measurement is 4 868 ms wall / 3 179 ms CPU
-- for the desktop panel's 30-day window on the operator's 342.8 MB ledger, and
-- 2 764 ms / 2 134 ms CPU for the FIRST touch of a fresh copy, which is what a
-- cold start feels like. The rollup answers the same window in 187 ms wall /
-- 166 ms CPU, reads 1.1 MB instead of the ledger's hundreds, and its cost stops
-- tracking ledger growth. Every number here comes from the ONE recorded pair —
-- ``bench/analytics-rollup-before.json`` / ``-after.json``, both arms in one
-- session at load ~215-280 — and no other sample belongs in a comment.
--
-- ``day`` is the LOCAL calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD), from the same
-- ``_local_day_month`` the write path already uses for ``usage_daily``, so there
-- is ONE spelling of "which day is this". It is TEXT so a day range sorts
-- lexically. ``model_id`` is deliberately NOT in the key: nothing in
-- ``aggregate()`` groups by model (the per-model view is ``usage_daily``'s job),
-- and a key dimension no read consumes cannot be removed later without a table
-- rebuild.
--
-- ``parent_session_id`` holds ``_PARENT_EDGE_SQL`` FOR THIS BUCKET — the shared
-- parent rule, never a second spelling of it. NULL means "no edge in this
-- bucket"; the read combines buckets with the NULL-ignoring aggregate MAX, and
-- the upsert combines them with the NULL-safe COALESCE form, so the whole-window
-- edge is the same string as the ledger's. (SQLite's multi-argument ``MAX()``
-- returns NULL if ANY argument is NULL, unlike the aggregate — that trap is why
-- the combine is spelled out; see ``_SESSION_DAILY_UPSERT_SQL``.)
--
-- ``max_ts_ms`` is the newest call ts in the bucket and is what the read's
-- in-sync gate compares against the ledger's ``MAX(ts_ms)``.
--
-- NO FORWARD-FILL HERE, unlike ``usage_daily``: the rollup starts empty and is
-- filled by the backfill sweep (``analytics/backfill.py``), because a rollup
-- missing days the ledger still holds would serve a SMALLER number than the
-- audit trail. Until the sweep covers a day, reads of windows touching it fall
-- back to the ledger (see ``_session_daily_window``) — slower, never wrong.
--
-- Appended at the very END of this script on purpose: ``executescript`` runs it
-- as ONE unit, so a statement that raises silently drops every statement AFTER
-- it. Worst case here is losing this table, and nothing that already shipped

#: THE parent-edge rule, as one SQL expression, used by every surface that

#: about the same session — which is the exact defect this whole rollup was
#: written to eliminate, so letting it back in through two spellings of
#: "who is the parent" would be self-defeating (review F1).
#:
#: Read it inside-out. ``NULLIF(parent_session_id, '')`` discards the "no
#: parent" sentinel (the column is ``NOT NULL DEFAULT ''``); the outer
#: ``NULLIF(..., session_id)`` discards a SELF edge, of which the ledger holds

#: real edge is lost whenever the session's own id happens to sort above its
#: parent's. That is a lexical coin-flip, not a rule.
#:
#: ``MAX`` still picks one parent when a session genuinely carries rows under

        ledger written by the token-only release has no ``cost_*`` columns. Add
        each via ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`` (idempotent: skip the ones already
        present). Old rows take the column default — cost 0, unknown — so a
        pre-cost call reads as "unpriced", never as a confident $0. Called under
        ``_init_lock`` on open; a failure here degrades to the pre-migration
        shape rather than raising, because analytics is never a hard dependency.

        Records which OPTIONAL columns are ACTUALLY present afterward
        (``self._present_optional``) and rebuilds the per-DB insert plan from it:
        if an ALTER failed, that column is dropped from the insert AND read as 0
        in the aggregate, so a missing column cannot fail every write and blank
        the screen (review C2, generalised to every optional column via Option A).

        RANK-GATED, which is the whole reason this is not a plain upsert. The
        ledger is now mirrored from several sources that do not arrive in
        quality order — the provisional stand-in lands at submit, the model's
        title a second or two later, a resume restores whichever was journalled,
        and a startup backfill reconstructs one from disk at any time. Letting
        the last writer win would have a provisional excerpt displace a real
        title, which is precisely the precedence ``session/naming.py`` protects
        on the live holder. The ``WHERE excluded.rank >= session_names.rank``
        clause makes the same rule true of the ledger: a same-or-better source
        may correct the row, a weaker one may only fill an empty slot — and an
        EMPTY incumbent name counts as an empty slot at any rank (see the
        ``session_names.name = ''`` arm of the gate below).

        Equal rank still overwrites, deliberately: a re-title is the same rank
        as the title it replaces and MUST be able to replace it.

        An empty ``name`` is rejected outright rather than written. Storing one
        creates a row that is simultaneously PRESENT (so it pins a rank) and
        MISSING (``sessions_missing_names`` selects on ``name = ''``), which the
        startup backfill would re-derive and re-attempt on every launch forever
        while the rank gate rejected it — unbounded work that can never
        converge. The recorder already guards this; the store is the shared
        surface, so the guard belongs here too.

        """Delete rows past their retention window. Returns raw-ledger rows removed.

        Three independent windows are enforced in one call, none affecting the
        others:

        - The raw ``calls`` ledger keeps ``retention_days`` (default 90) by
          ``ts_ms`` — unchanged; its row count is the return value, preserving
          the original contract.
        - ``tool_calls`` keeps the SAME ``retention_days`` window by ``ts_ms``.
          It is a raw per-event ledger like ``calls`` and grows with tool-call
          volume rather than request volume, so it needs the bound more than
          ``calls`` does. Its rows are NOT added to the return value, which
          contractually counts raw-ledger requests.
        - ``usage_daily`` keeps the most recent 365 DISTINCT ``day`` values
          (not 365 rows — each day holds one row per model), so the daily bar
          can look back a year regardless of how many models ran. The subquery
          finds the 365th-newest distinct day and deletes everything older.
        - ``session_daily`` keeps the SAME ``retention_days`` window as the raw
          ledger, by the stored ``day`` STRING (so a machine idle for weeks does
          not drop a recent bucket). It is not read by ``daily_series``; it is
          what ``aggregate()`` reads. WHY NOT LONGER, unlike ``usage_daily``:
          the read gate clamps every window's low end up to the ledger's oldest
          surviving day and refuses outright when the prune cut inside that day
          (``ledger_whole_from_day``), because a rollup day is whole while a
          pruned ledger day is only a remainder — so a day the ledger has
          dropped can never be SERVED, and keeping more of them would be storage
          no read can reach. The reach of this table is therefore the ledger's
          reach, and this constant tracks it on purpose (review R6; the
          follow-up that would serve all-time from the rollup is what would
          raise it, together with the label that change needs).
        - ``usage_monthly`` keeps the most recent 120 DISTINCT months — a
          10-year safety cap on an effectively-unbounded table (12 rows/year ×
          models is negligible), so the monthly arc survives far beyond the
          daily window without growing without limit.

        The rollup prunes are keyed on the stored ``day``/``month`` STRINGS, not
        on ``now_ms``: they keep the newest N buckets that exist rather than a
        window relative to the wall clock, so a machine idle for a week does not
        silently drop a still-recent bucket. ``now_ms`` is still injected for
        the ledger cutoff (and for tests). Each statement is guarded on its own
        so a missing rollup table (a very old DB mid-migration) degrades to
        pruning what it can rather than raising.

        Called by the recorder after an owned maintenance sweep (see
        ``recorder._run_owned_maintenance``), on the writer thread's connection.
        Returns True when the file was truncated.

        WHY PASSIVE FIRST, AND WHY THE TRUNCATE IS GATED ON IT. A checkpoint
        that has to wait for a reader is a stall on the analytics writer thread,
        and the wait is the connection's ``busy_timeout``: measured in
        ``.perf/bench/lane2``, a ``wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`` behind a reader
        pinning an old snapshot took **5.183 s** (the 5000 ms the connection
        carries) and then gave up with ``(busy=1, log=3011, checkpointed=2)``;
        with ``busy_timeout=0`` the same call was refused in **0.000 s** with the
        same row. So the busy handler DOES apply to ``wal_checkpoint``, and the
        worst case is a full busy timeout per attempt. This method therefore
        never asks for a checkpoint that can wait:

        * ``PASSIVE`` never blocks on readers — it checkpoints what it can and
          returns. Measured behind the same pinning reader: ``(0, 3011, 2)`` in
          **0.000 s**, i.e. it backfilled 2 of 3011 frames and reported it
          without waiting. Its row is ``(busy, log, checkpointed)``, and the
          important part is that a HALF-done checkpoint still reports
          ``busy=0``: ``log == checkpointed`` is the completeness test, not the
          busy flag alone.
        * ``TRUNCATE`` runs ONLY when that passive pass was complete, and with
          the busy handler off for the duration, so it can be refused but can
          never wait. Measured on a WAL nothing was pinning: ``(0, 0, 0)`` in
          0.001 s and the file went to 0 bytes.

        A checkpoint that cannot make progress is SKIPPED rather than waited on.
        Nothing is lost: the sweep is hourly and idempotent, the next owned
        sweep retries, and ``journal_size_limit`` (see
        ``_WAL_SIZE_LIMIT_BYTES``) still truncates the file at the WAL restart
        that the completed passive pass has just made possible — so a WAL that
        grew to the size of the database shrinks to the limit even in an hour
        where the gated truncate could not run.

        WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. ``journal_size_limit`` alone does NOT shrink an
        already-large WAL: measured, a 24,781,832 byte file stayed at
        24,781,832 with the limit set to 4 MiB or 16 MiB, and only a truncate (or
        a restart AFTER a complete checkpoint) took it down. The limit bounds
        FUTURE growth; this method is what reclaims what is already there. Do not
        read the pragma as the fix for a 528 MB WAL.

        - a normal pass heals a HOLE and fills the FRONTIER. The hole is every
          day since the previous pass recorded its own top
          (``last_sweep_day``), because that is exactly the range a ``lop`` still
          running the pre-rollup binary can have written into: it stamps
          ``ts_ms`` at record time, so it can only ever add rows to days from the
          last launch onward. Pinning that range is what makes the healing cover
          it — before this, only the newest three days were re-derived, so a
          stale row one launch older than that was served as exact forever
          (review R3). The frontier is the walk below ``covered_from_day`` down
          to the oldest day the ledger still holds, so a read that only needs the
          last few days becomes fast after a few transactions rather than after
          the whole sweep.
        - ``rebucket`` re-labels every day when the machine's zone has changed
          (travel, a ``TZ=``-prefixed one-off run). It is the recovery for the
          zone latch (review R2): the alternative was refusing the fast path
          forever, which loses the feature silently for a cause the user cannot
          see or undo.

        Bounded by the LEDGER, not by a constant: the walk stops at the oldest
        day the ledger still holds, because going below it would delete rollup
        history the ledger can no longer confirm. ``max_days`` only caps how much

        THE POINT OF THE SEPARATE COMMIT: while the sweep is re-labelling, the

        which keeps reads off a half-re-labelled table for as long as the
        mismatch stands, and the mismatch cannot clear except by finishing. This
        flips the table to the new zone only after every day the ledger can
        answer has been re-derived, so after it commits the fast path works again
        and before it commits nothing is served — fail-closed in both directions.

        WHAT IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE, stated because the comments used to overclaim
        it (review R12): a re-label interrupted mid-span leaves days labelled by
        the new rule beside days labelled by the old one, and if the process then
        returns to the OLD zone the zone precondition passes and those days are
        servable. That is harmless for THIS reader, for a reason worth writing
        down: ``aggregate()`` serves window-level facts only, and a call
        misassigned between two days *inside* the window changes no window total,
        while the count check pins the window's total to the ledger's. What the
        gate guarantees is "the served window's total is the ledger's", not "the
        labels belong to the recorded zone".

        IRRELEVANT TODAY, LOAD-BEARING TOMORROW: any future PER-DAY consumer of
        this table — the deferred all-time-from-rollup change, or moving the daily
        chart onto it — inherits the weaker property as it stands and would be
        served misassigned days. Such a read needs its own per-day check; the
        verify pass cannot repair a mixing that preserves each day's call COUNT,
        because both the gate and the verify compare counts.

        Everything outside ``[oldest_day, top_day]`` is DELETED, on both ends.
        Below, because a day the ledger can no longer answer is labelled with the
        old rule and nothing can confirm it; above, because moving west (say) can
        push every local day label one date EARLIER, which strands the buckets the
        old labels produced for the newest date above the new span — a day that
        survives the delete-below and then makes the window count disagree with
        the ledger, i.e. a permanent ``count-mismatch`` out of a repaired table.

        never reaches them, so they were served as exact for the life of the
        table. Comparing per day finds them wherever they are, and re-deriving
        the day is what removes them.

        Cost: two index-only queries per day, measured at ~2.5 ms per label —

        Optionally scoped to a time window and/or a single session. The result
        carries flat totals, a per-provider breakdown, and a per-session
        breakdown (each a one-level :class:`UsageAggregate`) so the report can
        render every table it needs from a single call. An unopenable or empty
        store returns a zeroed aggregate, which the screen renders as "no data
        yet" rather than an error.

        TWO PATHS, ONE ANSWER. The same three grouped reads exist twice: over
        ``session_daily`` (the maintained day-grain rollup, cheap, and what the
        panel opens with) and over ``calls`` (the raw ledger, the original shape
        and now the FALLBACK). Which one runs is decided by
        :meth:`_session_daily_window`, which returns a refusal reason instead of
        a window whenever any precondition does not hold. FAIL CLOSED is the
        whole point: a wrong fast-path number is far worse than a slow one, so
        every precondition is checked and the ledger path — today's behaviour,
        bit for bit — runs otherwise.

        The two paths assemble their rows through :meth:`_assemble_aggregate`,
        so `dataclasses.asdict` equality between them is structural rather than
        a thing two code blocks are separately trusted to maintain.

        ONE SNAPSHOT FOR THE WHOLE ANSWER (review R13). Every statement here —
        the gate's five checks, its count verification, and all three grouped
        reads — runs inside ONE ``BEGIN DEFERRED``. Without it each statement is
        autocommit and therefore a different WAL snapshot: the gate could approve
        a window on rows the read then no longer sees, which is precisely the
        hole the count check exists to close, and the ledger path's three scans
        could likewise disagree with each other about totals that are supposed
        to sum to the headline. A read transaction cannot block a writer under
        WAL, so the cost is a slightly longer-lived read snapshot and nothing
        else.

        Any other outcome is ``(None, reason)`` and the caller runs the ledger

        "may the rollup be trusted for this window", never "is the rollup close
        enough". A window it cannot prove is a window it refuses, because the
        cost of a wrong number on this screen is not comparable to the cost of
        being slow (the operator's rule: wrong beats slow).

        The five preconditions, and why each one can fail on a real machine:

        ``no-rollup-table``  the schema script aborted before the CREATE TABLE,
            or this is a ledger old enough that it never ran it.
        ``empty-ledger``     nothing to serve; the ledger path is trivially fast.
        ``no-parent-column``  a ledger predating ``parent_session_id``. The
            rollup's buckets are derived from the SAME snapshots, so their
            edges would be visible where the ledger's ``_PARENT_EDGE_SQL``
            substitutes ``''`` — the two surfaces would disagree about the tree.
            Kept as DEFENCE IN DEPTH, and the honest scope of that: through
            ``aggregate()`` the rollup read is never reached in this state,
            because this refusal fires first. The read also substitutes ``''``
            when the predicate is false (round 1 Q2), which is what makes it
            safe if the guard is ever bypassed — but the guarded shape itself is
            NOT closed, and the count check cannot see an edge divergence by
            construction. See the note above the substitution in
            :meth:`_session_daily_aggregate` for the measured difference.
            ``_migrate`` normally makes the state unreachable anyway, so this is
            named rather than silently absent.
        ``not-day-aligned``  ``aggregate()`` accepts arbitrary millisecond
            bounds; the rollup is day-grain. A bound that is not the first
            instant of a local day cannot be expressed as a day range, so the
            ledger answers it. This is the assumption the whole design rests on
            (both real callers are day-aligned or unbounded) and therefore the
            first thing the gate refuses.
        ``zone-changed``     the buckets were labelled in a different local zone
            (travel, a laptop moved across a zone, a re-run under ``TZ=``).
            Historic buckets are then labelled by the old rule while the read
            derives local midnights by the new one, which misattributes rows
            near every day boundary by up to the offset delta. This is a
            refusal the sweep is expected to CLEAR, not one it lives with: the
            worklist sees the mismatch and re-labels every day the ledger can
            still answer in ONE pass (its work is bounded by the ledger's own
            day span, not by any per-pass budget), publishing the new zone only
            once the whole span is done (``commit_session_daily_rebucket``).
            Until that commits, the recorded zone is the old one and reads keep
            refusing — so the state is fail-closed while it is being repaired,
            which is why this reason must never be treated as a permanent
            condition (review R2, R11).
        ``no-coverage``      the backfill has not swept far enough down yet: days
            at or after ``covered_from_day`` are complete, anything older is a
            hole. This is also the state of every existing ledger on the upgrade
            launch, and of a rollup whose tables exist but hold nothing — a
            missing ``covered_from_day`` with no zone recorded (review round 1
            Q1: the two states are distinguishable and this is the label for the
            one with nothing to mislabel).
        ``empty-window``     the day range is empty (``until_ms`` is not after
            ``since_ms`` once both are day-aligned). Not an error, but the
            ledger answers it exactly, so there is nothing to gain here.
        ``unreadable: <T>``  a rollup or meta read raised — a schema script that
            lost its tail, a file that went read-only mid-open. Nothing can be
            proven about the table, so nothing is served from it.
        ``ledger-bottom-partial``  the retention prune cut INSIDE the ledger's
            oldest surviving day. The rollup holds that day whole while the
            ledger holds only its remainder, so a window including it would
            over-count. The prune records where the cut landed
            (``ledger_whole_from_day``); this refuses windows reaching below it.
        ``tail-unsynced``    the ledger's newest row is newer than the rollup's.
            The two advance in one transaction, so this means something wrote
            ``calls`` WITHOUT maintaining the rollup — a ``lop`` still running
            the pre-rollup binary. Cheap to check (both sides are an indexed
            MAX) and it is the difference between "the rollup is current" and
            "the rollup is current as of whenever it was last written". A rollup
            that was emptied while its meta kept a matching zone arrives here
            too (``0 != the ledger's newest``), which is why there is no separate
            empty-rollup branch (review R7) — but the empty-with-empty-meta state
            is refused earlier, as ``no-coverage`` (round 1 Q1).

        ``count-mismatch``   the window's own row count is not the ledger's. The
            other checks each pin a boundary — the tail pins the newest row,
            coverage the oldest day, the zone the labelling rule — so a hole in
            the MIDDLE of a window is invisible to all of them, and a pre-rollup
            writer leaves exactly that as soon as a maintained process writes a
            newer row. Compared directly (21.8-26.7 ms on a 1.2 M-call ledger;
            see the precondition's comment for what share of the fast path that
            is — quoting this check without its pair is how it came to be
            described as ~5 ms twice) rather
            than inferred, because this is the one that decides whether a total
            is right. It is also the check that makes a hole SELF-CLEARING
            rather than permanent: the sweep verifies day by day and re-derives
            the days that disagree (``session_daily_mismatched_days``), so the
            refusal lasts until the next launch instead of for the life of the
            table (review R3).

        ``rollup-read-failed`` is the one post-hoc reason, not returned here: it
        is set by :meth:`aggregate` when the gate said yes and the rollup query
        then raised. A fast path that cannot answer is a slow path, so that is a
        fallback rather than an error — but it is logged, because a fast path
        that always throws is a bug dressed as correctness.

        The window is returned as a half-open ``day`` string range for
        ``day >= lo AND day < hi``, built from ``_local_day_month`` — the same
        function the writer buckets with, so there is one spelling of "which day
        is this". ``day_lo`` is additionally clamped up to the ledger's oldest
        day: post-prune the rollup can hold days the ledger has dropped, and
        serving them from an unbounded window would return rows the ledger path
        cannot.

        # sit here was 26.7 ms over the SUPERSEDED 123 ms arm, which is the
        # error this PR was already corrected for once. Either way it pays for

        Returns ``(None, ())`` when the walk cannot run — an older ledger with
        no ``parent_session_id`` column — which the report renders as "unknown"
        rather than as "$0.00 of subagent spend". Runs on the caller's pinned
        read transaction so the subtree and the own scope describe the same WAL
        snapshot.

        A level-by-level descent on the caller's pinned transaction, NOT the
        recursive CTE this originally used. The CTE could only apply the shared
        edge rule as a correlated scalar subquery re-evaluated per candidate row,
        which measured 620 ms on the widest real fan-out (46 children) against
        6.7 ms for this descent — and expressing the rule as an ``edges``
        CTE instead costs a full 196 ms scan of ``calls``. Each level is two
        indexed statements on the SAME pinned transaction, so the single-snapshot
        property the CTE was chosen for is preserved. Measured end to end on the
        475k-row ledger: 0.87 ms for the reported session, 6.7 ms worst case.
        Without ``idx_calls_parent`` each level is a full scan — see
        ``_OPTIONAL_INDEXES``.

        Three guards, because the ledger contains a real cycle edge (224 rows
        carry ``parent_session_id == session_id``, all from a degenerate empty
        id):

        1. A candidate is kept only when its CANONICAL parent (the one shared
           rule, ``_canonical_parents``) is the node currently being expanded.
           This is what makes the walk agree with ``/analytics`` by construction
           rather than by coincidence: a session whose rows merely mention this
           node, but whose canonical parent is some other session, is not a child
           here — and the aggregate would not have drawn that edge
           either (review F1). It also subsumes the old self-edge predicate,
           since the rule discards a self parent in SQL, before the MAX.
        2. ``visited`` means a cycle that re-reaches an already-counted session
           stops there, so no session contributes its calls twice.
        3. ``depth < _MAX_TREE_DEPTH`` bounds the walk whatever the data does.
           See that constant for why its anchor differs from the forest's.

        Note on retention: ``prune`` deletes by ``ts_ms``, so a root whose
        children aged out first reports a smaller subtree than it really spent.
        Parent and child age out together in practice; a shrinking figure here
        is retention, not a rollup bug.
