"""The three cascade legs: Radient, TypeSafe, OpenRouter.

They are three `POST`s with byte-identical bodies (`docs/design/classification-layer.md`
§3), which is the whole reason the cascade is a list and not a branch. This
module owns only the parts that genuinely differ per leg — endpoint, model id,
credential resolution — plus the one shared wire codec and the one shared error
taxonomy. Everything about *ordering*, fallback and disabling lives in
:mod:`local_operator.classification.cascade` and
:mod:`local_operator.classification.service`.

WHY THE CLIENT IS INJECTED, AND WHO OWNS IT
===========================================

A leg takes an ``httpx.AsyncClient`` rather than making one per request. A
connection plus a TLS handshake to ``api.radienthq.com`` is 50-150 ms on its
own, and this layer runs once per user message on the critical path before the
turn's first token — so paying that per message would spend the entire latency
budget on a handshake. :class:`~local_operator.classification.service.ClassificationService`
therefore owns ONE keep-alive client for the session and injects it here (and
``httpx.MockTransport`` is how the tests inject a fake one). A leg used without
an injected client still works — it opens one for the call — which keeps the
classes usable on their own in a diagnostic or a one-off script.

HOW A LEG FINDS ITS CREDENTIAL — LOGIN FIRST, LEGACY KEY BEHIND IT
=================================================================

The order is the provider stack's, and it is the same for all three legs
(:meth:`_HttpDecisionVendor._resolve_key`):

1. **The ``AuthStore`` row for the provider** — ``auth.db``, read-only. This is
   where an interactive login puts a key: ``ProviderController.login`` does
   ``upsert_credential(store_credentials_as or provider_id, {"key": <pasted>,
   "source": "login", "type": "api_key"})``, and for Radient it is the OAuth
   session ``lop login radient`` wrote. A leg that skipped this store silently
   ignored ``lop login typesafe`` — the user saw "Stored API key" and the
   classifier then fell through to the next leg, or to no vendor at all.

   **This tier is PREFERRED, deliberately.** An OAuth session is the account the
   operator is signed into and the route we bill; a pasted key is the legacy
   path, kept working rather than leading. So a machine that has BOTH uses the
   login row, and the static key is a fallback rather than the default.
2. **The provider-class store row, then the process environment** — the
   ``LOP_PROVIDER_<env key>`` row a login or ``lop credential update`` wrote,
   else an exported variable. Still needed explicitly: the store's own env tier
   reads only a provider's *single-string* ``env_keys``, so a tuple like
   TypeSafe's ``("TYPESAFE_API_KEY", "JEV_API_KEY")`` is not covered there,
   and neither is ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY_DEV``. This is the LEGACY tier the
   ladder below falls back to when the login row cannot serve. The plaintext
   ``credentials.env`` leg is GONE (PR2a) — a name neither the store nor the
   environment holds resolves to nothing.
3. **The vendor-specific alternates** — ``JEV_API_KEY`` for TypeSafe,
   ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY_DEV`` behind the production key for OpenRouter.
4. ``None`` — "this leg has no credential", which the cascade treats as "skip".

``read_only=True`` for the same reason ``providers/radient_credentials.py`` uses
it: a decorative classifier call must not block a credential, move account
stickiness or decide routing. A required OAuth refresh still persists centrally
inside the store, which is that account's own bookkeeping.

CREDENTIALS ARE MEMOIZED WITH A SHORT TTL
=========================================

``AuthStore.get_api_key`` walks a 7-step cascade over SQLite and can refresh an
OAuth grant over the network; on this path that may happen once per user
message. So a resolved credential is memoized on the LEG INSTANCE — which lives
on the service instance, never in a module-level global, because two sessions in
one process may be signed into different accounts and a global would send one
account's key in another's request.

The memo expires after :data:`CREDENTIAL_TTL_S` (5 minutes), matching the
agent-server's own auth cache (``internal/cache/auth_cache.go``,
``defaultAuthCacheTTL = 5 * time.Minute``). The TTL is what bounds staleness: a
memo with no TTL keeps using a key the operator has since rotated or logged out
of, for the whole session. And when a leg answers 401/403, the memo is dropped
and the credential re-resolved ONCE — never in a loop — so a rotated key heals
on the next message while a genuinely dead one stops costing a request per
message. If that re-resolve hands back the SAME value, the tier itself is dead
for this session and the walk advances to the next one: a stored login that
cannot serve must not strand the legacy static key sitting one tier below it
(:meth:`_HttpDecisionVendor._advance_tier`).

NO KEY EVER LEAVES THIS MODULE
==============================

Credential values are read here and handed straight to an ``Authorization``
header. They are never logged, never interpolated into an error message and
never returned in :class:`~local_operator.classification.types.DecisionResponse`.
:class:`DecisionVendorError` carries the upstream status and a truncated body —
and that body goes through the shared ``scrub_secrets`` (with THIS leg's own
credential passed as an exact value), because an upstream that echoes the
``Authorization`` header back in a refusal is the one realistic route by which a
key could otherwise reach a log line from here.

        or exported, which is the LEGACY tier. The order is the contract (see the

        The starting tier is READ from :attr:`_tier` rather than taken as an

        is read before falling through to the process environment, so a store
        row the operator saved outranks an ambient export. That keeps the tier
        vocabulary unchanged — an index still names one credential. The legacy
