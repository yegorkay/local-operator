    asked for it twice. A runtime child builds five managers before it can

    ``read_model_choice`` calls, ``read_effort_tier_selectors``), so one session

    (CPU-clock cProfile), on a host at load 100+ where one CPU millisecond costs
    10-17 ms of wall time.

    install that moves under a live process is a different question with its

    WHY. Every ``ConfigManager`` re-read and re-parsed the file, and a session's
    construction path builds five of them (see :func:`_package_version`). The
    pure-Python ``SafeLoader`` costs ~2 ms of CPU per parse on the operator's
    1.6 KB file and ~8 ms on a seeded one, and YAML was the largest single item
    in a runtime child's pre-publication CPU after imports: 185 of ~440 ms,
    measured. At this host's load (100 ms of CPU = 1.0-1.7 s of wall) that is
    seconds of "starting…" on every cold engage.

    THE INVALIDATION STORY. The key is ``(inode, device, size, mtime_ns,
    ctime_ns)`` from ``fstat`` on the OPEN descriptor, taken on every call, and
    a hit needs all five to match:

    * every writer in this codebase replaces the file atomically
      (``_write_config``: temp file + ``os.replace``), which gives the path a NEW
      inode, so a replaced file can never match the old key;
    * an in-place rewrite (an editor, ``>>``) moves ``mtime_ns`` and
      ``ctime_ns``; ``ctime`` cannot be set back by any process, even with
      ``os.utime``;
    * ``fstat`` on the descriptor we read from, not ``stat`` on the path, so the
      key always describes the file the bytes come from, even if the path is
      swapped between the open and the read.

    So the memo only ever answers for bytes the open file still holds: it
    removes the PARSE, never the freshness check. A second ``fstat`` after the
    read gates the store, so a write that lands DURING the read is not cached
    under the key of the bytes it replaced. A parse error propagates uncached:
    the caller moves a bad file aside and the next read must see what replaced it.

    CALLERS GET A DEEP COPY, because a manager merges defaults into the dict it
    loads, in place, and managers must never share state — see
    :func:`_fresh_default_config` for the incident behind that rule.
