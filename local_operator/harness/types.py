"""Core harness types — the binding contract between all rewrite streams.

This module defines the ``packages/agent`` type surface. It deliberately knows
NOTHING about sessions, providers, persistence, skills, or UI. Every other
stream programs against these types:

- ``Message`` / ``CustomMessage`` — LLM-visible conversation entries.
- ``ToolCall`` / ``ToolResult`` / ``AgentTool`` — the tool protocol.
- ``AgentEvent`` — the ONLY boundary between engine and UI (TUI, print mode,
  server websockets all subscribe to these).
- ``LoopConfig`` — the callback bundle injected into the loop. The loop never
  imports session or provider code; everything is a callback here.
- ``ModelSpec`` / ``ChatRequest`` / ``StreamEvent`` — the provider wire
  contract implemented by ``local_operator.providers.clients``.

Design notes carried over from the reference engine:

- Messages carry an optional ``provider_payload`` for provider-native replay
  data (e.g. OpenAI Responses ids, Anthropic encrypted thinking). It rides
  through history untouched and is consumed only by wire clients.
- ``CustomMessage`` is the extension point for host-authored entries
  (compaction summaries, skill prompts, wake deliveries). It renders to an
  LLM-visible message via the session's ``convert_to_llm`` and NEVER goes to
  a provider raw.
- Aside commit/discard: the reference engine attaches symbols to message
  objects; here they
  are explicit optional callables excluded from serialization
  (``compare=False``), invoked by the loop when an aside message is actually
  injected (commit) or dropped as stale (discard).

#: so the ledger's spelling cannot drift between writer and classifier.
FAULT_KEY = "__fault"

#: The single fault class a TOOL BODY may assert about itself: the arguments
#: the model emitted were MALFORMED. Lives here for the same layering reason;

FAULT_INVALID_ARGUMENTS = "invalid_arguments"

#: Key under which a SYNTHETIC tool result records that the OUTPUT LIMIT is why
#: its call never ran. A harness bookkeeping key like ``FAULT_KEY`` above, and
#: declared in the same place for the same reason: the loop writes it and a
#: display surface reads it, so one spelling has to hold for both.
#:
#: WHAT IT IS FOR. The text of those results is written for the MODEL, and the
#: one the length arm appends is prose addressed to it ("Reply with the call
#: itself, not with an explanation of why it cannot be sent"). The same text is
#: the tool message the transcript persists, so a resumed row used to paint
#: model-directed instruction as the operator's own receipt (review round 1,
#: F2). The row therefore takes its words from
#: ``harness.rows.output_limit_call_receipt`` instead, and this key is the whole
#: input to that decision — a surface must key on the MARKER, never on the
#: wording, so a later reword of the model-facing text cannot change what an
#: operator reads.
OUTPUT_LIMIT_KEY = "__output_limit"

#: JSON fragment that never parsed. Only this arm may tell the model its
#: arguments were oversize and would be cut again.
OUTPUT_LIMIT_ARGUMENTS = "arguments"

#: ...or the turn ended at the limit with this call's arguments already
#: COMPLETE, so the call is intact and simply never ran. The two arms are
#: different facts and must not be collapsed: asserting the first for a call

class InvalidToolArgumentsError(ValueError):
    """The model emitted an argument this tool cannot parse.

    Raise this — never a bare ``ValueError`` — when an argument's SHAPE is
    wrong, and the executor records the call as ``invalid_arguments`` (a MODEL
    fault, counted in the tool-call error rate) instead of ``execution``.

    **MALFORMED, NOT MERELY UNSATISFIABLE. Read this before raising it.**
    The test is whether the argument could ever have been valid, not whether
    the call succeeded:

    - Malformed — raise this. ``range='"270-330"'`` is not a line range in any
      world; ``pattern='('`` is not a regex. The model could have known, from
      the schema alone, that the value was wrong before sending it.
    - Unsatisfiable — do NOT raise this; return an ordinary error result and
      let it classify as ``execution``. A path that does not exist, an HTTP
      500, a refused credential, a file that vanished between planning and
      execution. The argument was well-formed; the world did not cooperate.
      A missing file is the canonical case and is explicitly NOT a model fault
      even though it arrives at the same handler.

    Why the boundary is worth this much prose: ``invalid_arguments`` feeds
    ``analytics.model.MODEL_FAULTS``, and therefore the published
    ``validity`` / ``tool_call_error_rate`` benchmark figures. Marking an
    unsatisfiable call as a model fault INFLATES the error rate, which is the
    worse failure direction — under-reporting is merely incomplete, while
    over-reporting corrupts the measurement. When a case is genuinely
    ambiguous, leave it as ``execution``.

    This exists because a JSON-Schema type is coarser than an argument's real
    grammar. ``read``'s ``range`` is typed ``str | None``, so ``'"270-330"'``
    passes ``validate_tool_arguments`` and fails in the tool body — arriving
    at the generic handler indistinguishable from a genuine execution failure.
    The class is known where the value is parsed and nowhere else, which is
    exactly the principle ``AgentLoop._classify_fault`` is built on: the
    marker is SET at the source, never text-matched out of a message
    afterwards.

class EnvironmentDependentRejectionError(ValueError):
    """A validator refused a value for a reason OUTSIDE the arguments.

    The escape hatch from :class:`InvalidToolArgumentsError`, for the case a
    params model rejects a value by consulting live config, the environment,
    the filesystem or the clock rather than by inspecting the argument's
    shape. Such a rejection is NOT the model's fault: the value may be exactly
    what the advertised schema offered, and the world moved underneath it.

    The motivating case is ``effort``. Its enum is rendered into the schema at
    tool-BUILD time from the configured tiers, but the validator re-checks the
    tier against config at CALL time. Between the two, an operator can edit a
    tier away — or ``config.yml`` can simply become unreadable, which
    ``configured_effort_tiers`` deliberately reports as "no tiers" rather than
    raising, precisely so a corrupt config costs a tier picker and not a
    session. Without this class the model emits the one value its own schema
    contained, gets refused, and is billed a model fault for the operator's
    config — inflating the published benchmark in the direction
    :class:`InvalidToolArgumentsError` calls the worse one.

    Raise it from inside a pydantic validator; ``ValidationError.errors()``
    preserves the original exception under ``ctx['error']``, which is how the
    tool layer tells this apart from a static shape violation WITHOUT matching
    on message text. Any rejection that is a pure function of the arguments
    (``extra="forbid"``, a type error, a constrained int, a cross-field
    validator) must NOT use this — those are genuine model faults.

    scheduled wake firing while a turn is busy, and a ``hub`` note or
    question queued as an aside. They share one signal because a parked
    ``wait`` cares about exactly one thing, "is there something new to read",

    can tell the model WHY it woke instead of blaming every wake on a peer.

#: optionally led by one of two hazard markers:
#:
#: * ``[outside workspace]``: the target resolved, and it is not under the root.
#: * ``[unresolvable]``: the target could not be characterised at all, so nothing
#:   can be said about where it is. A describer may also return this in front of
#:   a sentence that is NOT ``<verb>: <target>`` — ``[unresolvable] unparsed url:
#:   <raw>`` — precisely because no verb-and-target pair could be determined.
#:
#: Both markers escalate identically; they differ only in the words the renderer
#: spells out, because a target visibly inside the workspace described as being
#: outside it teaches the reader to distrust the clause that matters. The cwd is
#: a parameter and not read
#: from the process because a session can be rooted anywhere (the server and the
#: scheduler both pass one), and "outside the workspace" is measured against the
#: session's root or it means nothing.
#:

#: deciding whether to authorise something: the decision-relevant argument is
#: buried between quoting and irrelevant fields, and no amount of clever
#: truncation in the UI can recover which end of a JSON blob matters. Only the
#: tool knows which of its arguments IS the decision.

#: plain ``(args, cwd)`` form every existing describer uses keeps working
#: untouched: the only describer that needs more is the path one, and the only

    nothing about the model's thinking reached any front end, so the whole
    reasoning phase was a still screen. Measured, on the same question: the
    first reasoning fragment arrives 455 ms before the first text token on a
    102-token prompt, and 1,750 ms before it on a 142k-token cached prompt --
    and 86.5% of deepseek-flash turns reason at all. This event is that channel
    made visible, and nothing more.

    DISPLAY-ONLY is the contract, and it is load-bearing in three places:

    * it never enters an assistant message's content, so it never reaches the
      transcript, the compaction summariser, or the next request's messages;
    * it is never written back as ``reasoning_content`` on the wire -- the echo
      deepseek 400s on, and the reason ``providers.clients._replay_chat_message``
      validates provenance at all;
    * ``Content`` (``TextContent | ImageContent``) is deliberately NOT extended

      transcript state, which is exactly what the two points above forbid; the
      event channel is the whole of its representation, so no consumer can

    ``message_id`` is the assistant message streaming when the fragment
    arrived, so a consumer can group one model call's reasoning and retire it
    when the answer starts. ``delta`` is the ONE fragment, never the accumulated
    text: reasoning arrives token by token, and a re-dumped accumulation is what
    made the desktop's frames oversize (``session/runtime/server.py``).

    A consumer that does not know this event renders exactly what it rendered
    before -- nothing.

    The ``type`` token is deliberately the wire fragment's OWN name
    (``StreamReasoningDelta``): this event is a 1:1 republication of that
    channel, so the shared word reads as one thing. The two are never seen by

    index-derived placeholder before that, so a UI can correlate this with the
    ``tool_execution_start`` that eventually follows.

    ``intent`` is the model's own ``i`` narration, scraped out of the partial
    JSON as soon as its string closes and ``None`` until then — never a
    half-word, because a label growing character by character on a repainting
    row reads worse than no label. This is the highest-value place the field
    appears: ``argument_bytes`` says the agent is alive, and only the intent
    says what for, across the longest silence of the turn.

    ``supersedes_tool_call_id`` announces that THIS frame and the frames that
    carried ``supersedes_tool_call_id`` as their id are the SAME call, whose
    real id has arrived. It is set only when the row was first announced under
    an index-derived placeholder, and then on EVERY later frame for that call:
    the identity moves once, but the announcement is repeated so a compacted or
    overflowing queue cannot drop the only copy of it. Applying it twice is
    defined to be the same as applying it once — the second time there is no
    placeholder left to retire.

    It exists because the two id spaces otherwise never meet. A provider that
    sends a call's ``name`` before its ``id`` makes the loop announce the row as
    ``compose:{index}``, while ``tool_execution_start``/``_end`` carry the
    provider's real id. Anything that keys rows by ``tool_call_id`` — the
    in-flight seed in ``_fold_live_event``, the TUI's composing cards, the
    mobile projection's rows — then holds TWO records for one call, and a
    viewer joining mid-turn is handed a composing row nothing can ever adopt or
    settle: at turn end it is painted ``⊘ interrupted`` on a call that
    SUCCEEDED. The promotion frame is what lets each of those consumers rekey
    the row it already has instead of opening a second one.

    Why an explicit announcement rather than silently re-deriving the key each
    frame: re-deriving is what this code used to do, and it changed the key
    mid-stream with nobody told, so the UI mounted a second row for one call and
    then marked the abandoned one interrupted (see the latch comment in
    ``harness/loop.py``). The identity moves exactly once, and it says so.

    Additive on purpose. An older runtime never sets it and every consumer
    keeps today's behaviour; an older viewer receiving it ignores it, because
    ``AgentEvent`` allows extra fields.

    ``dictation_complete`` marks the LAST frame of a call's dictation — the one
    the producer cannot send again, because the step's stream has ended. It
    exists because a composing row is a PREDICTION that a call exists, and the
    producer used to announce the prediction's beginning and then only one of
    its three endings (the call starts; it is queued behind a sibling's
    execution group and starts much later; it never runs at all). A call
    composed in a batch that ends with ``wait(wait_ms=1800000)`` ahead of an
    ``exclusive`` sibling therefore kept a row saying ``composing…`` — with a
    ticking clock — for the sibling's whole half-hour, which is exactly how it
    was reported. The frame carries the final ``argument_bytes`` (not merely the
    last reported one) so the row it settles keeps the size it really reached.

    ``not_run_reason`` is the never-run ending, bounded to one clipped line (the
    wire and the seed both budget text, and this rides both), and set only on a
    call parked at planning or skipped by steering. Those calls deliberately
    have no ``tool_execution_start``/``_end`` — the API server matches tool
    records by id, and a synthetic start would claim the tool ran — so the
    compose surface is the only one that announced them and the only one that
    can honestly settle them.

    #
    # What is MEASURED, live against ``api.deepseek.com/v1`` (2026-09-12,
    # ``deepseek-flash``, thinking on): the request rebuilt from the transcript
    # at the point of failure (491 messages, 230 assistant turns, 66 of them
    # with no ``reasoning_content``) is REFUSED, and the same body with a
    # non-blank ``reasoning_content`` on every assistant turn is ACCEPTED --
    # repeatedly, for both that session and a minimal synthetic tool loop. A
    # body whose assistant turns all carry a blank value is accepted on one
    # shape where the same body with the keys absent is refused, which is what
    # moved the harness to send a real sentence rather than a blank -- but that
    # single shape is NOT evidence about the rule in general (the accepted
    # key-less bodies in the counter-shapes below are why), and this field does
    # not conclude one.
    #
    # The exact server-side rule is NOT fully characterised, and this field does
    # not claim to encode it. Requests that omit the echo are accepted in other
    # shapes -- adding a trailing user turn to the failing body answered 200,
    # and tool-call ids copied from a reply the endpoint itself generated
    # answered 200 where the same ids with one character changed answered 400 --
    # which reads like server-side state (leniency for its own ids, or a prefix
    # effect) rather than a syntactic property of the body. Filling every blank
    # assistant turn is therefore a SUPERSET of what the failing shapes need: it
    # is measured-safe on the shapes that are refused, and on the shapes that
    # are accepted it changes nothing but those turns.
    #
    # The turns with nothing to carry back are ordinary, which is what makes the
    # harness unable to satisfy the demand out of its own history: the model
    # produced no reasoning at all (no ``usage.reasoning_tokens``) on ~29% of the
    # assistant turns in the session that reported this (``9daa47ece7ad``, 66 of
    # 230 turns in the request built at the point of failure), and a turn whose
    # native payload was dropped -- by an edit, a truncation/abort, or a model,
    # endpoint or credential-scope change (see ``providers.replay``) -- has none
    # either. So the fix is compliance at the wire layer rather than better
    # capture.
    #
    # Derived from the model id at ``ModelSpec`` construction (see
    # ``_derive_deepseek_thinking_contract``) and, on the builder's path, in

    # to recognise a model name. It is set for the DeepSeek-hosted thinking-mode
    # family -- which is a property of the WEIGHTS, so it is set on every route
    # that can serve them, the aggregator routes included -- and it stays off for
    # the legacy ``deepseek-chat`` / ``deepseek-reasoner`` rows.
    #
    # **``None`` is "no caller stated a value", not a third state on the wire.**
    # The default is tri-state for one measured reason: a STATED ``False`` has to
    # survive a round trip, and a plain ``bool`` default cannot distinguish "this
    # spec says no echo" from "nobody filled the field" the moment a persister
    # dumps with ``exclude_defaults=True`` -- the ``False`` IS the default, so it
    # is dropped, and re-validating what is left derives the echo back on for a
    # route whose caller deliberately said otherwise. With ``None`` as the
    # default, ``False`` is no longer equal to it and survives the dump (pinned by
    # ``test_a_defaults_excluding_dump_survives_a_stated_false``).
    #
    # No VALIDATED spec carries ``None``: the construction hook resolves it to the
    # rule's answer, so every reader may treat this as a bool. Only a value that

        ``build_model_spec`` derived ``requires_reasoning_echo`` as a local, so a
        ``ModelSpec`` built any other way took the field default -- echo off, which
        is the HTTP 400 this capability exists to prevent ("The
        `reasoning_content` in the thinking mode must be passed back to the
        API"). Measured in the field: 76 sessions carry that refusal wording, and
        the incidents continue past the release that shipped the derivation. A
        spec built by any path OTHER than the builder is what this hook removes.

        Deriving it here rather than asking every construction site to remember is
        the point: a capability that has to be REMEMBERED at each site is one that
        will be dropped at the next one, and the failure is silent until a user's
        turn dies hundreds of messages deep. The rule itself is IMPORTED from
        ``model.configure.reasoning_echo_required`` and never restated -- two
        copies of a family regex drift, and then the builder and a directly-built
        spec disagree about the same model, which is the defect this method
        removes rather than moves.

        **Only the echo.** The effort LADDER is deliberately NOT derived here,
        and that was a review finding rather than a preference: the ladder is not
        only a wire input, it is what decides whether the status band paints an
        effort segment at all (``tui/widgets/status_line.py``), and the cold
        viewer and the desktop draft preview render specs built by this path -- so
        filling it here moved a rendered surface (a new ``auto`` segment) for a
        backend resilience fix. It also left the ladder with two owners, since
        ``build_model_spec`` resolves it from the provider's own LISTING first and
        no construction hook can see a listing. The ladder therefore keeps its one
        owner, ``build_model_spec``, and no behaviour here depends on it: the
        harness-side recovery in ``harness/loop.py`` re-sends with the echo filled
        and needs no rung -- verified live on the worst case, capability off AND
        ladder empty.

        **Runs only for a spec being BUILT from a model id**, which is what makes
        it "cannot be dropped by omission" rather than "cannot be stated at all":

        * a mapping (``ModelSpec(provider=..., model_id=...)``,
          ``model_validate({...})``, the wire) is filled in only when it does not
          carry a value, so a caller that never heard of the capability -- or a
          spec rebuilt from a record written before it existed -- still lands on
          the right answer;
        * a value the caller DID state is left alone, because that is a statement
          rather than an omission. ``None`` means "unstated" (see the field's own
          docstring for why the default is tri-state), so both an absent key and
          an explicit ``None`` get the rule's answer;
        * an existing spec INSTANCE is not rewritten at all. Pydantic re-runs an
          ``after``-mode validator against a nested instance in place, which is
          why this is a ``before``-mode one: the instrument that reproduces the
          pre-fix body (``scripts/deepseek_reasoning_echo_probe.py``) and the
          loop's own regression tests state "this spec does not carry the echo",
          and a construction hook that overwrote them would delete the
          measurement rather than fix the bug. A spec only ever becomes an
          instance by passing through this hook first, so nothing is lost by
          trusting it.

        Scoped so nothing else moves. ``reasoning_echo_required`` is False for
        every family but the DeepSeek thinking one (the legacy ``deepseek-chat`` /
        ``deepseek-reasoner`` rows and a local user-operated server included), and
        it answers only for a spec that stated nothing -- so no route, and no
        caller with an opinion, can have behaviour changed here.

    #: the denial is enforced, because an enumeration with an unlisted member is

    #:
    #: 1. ``FailoverRouteState`` is session-sticky. A naming failure that walked
    #:    to a fallback target would ``activate`` it with a 60-second cooldown,
    #:    moving the TURN onto the fallback model — and a naming SUCCESS on the

    #:    *Denied in* ``stream_with_failover``: ``route_state = None``, which
    #:    kills the target narrowing, the ``activate`` and the ``clear``.
    #: 2. ``AuthStore.rotate_sibling`` mutates the session's sticky credential,
    #:    so an auth failure on a title would re-point the turn's account.
    #:    *Denied in* ``stream_with_failover``: ``retry.enabled = False``, which
    #:    also removes the fallback chain and the backoff budget — every
    #:    rotation path sits behind it. The one exception is the errand's
    #:    single auth re-resolve, which deliberately does NOT rotate: it
    #:    re-reads the pool with the rejected bearer hidden and only spends a
    #:    second wire attempt when that read yields a different bearer.
    #: 3. ``SessionStreamFn`` consumes a pending message boundary to classify
    #:    auto-effort. Whoever arrives first spends it, so a naming call would
    #:    freeze the turn's effort from ITS prompt and emit an "auto effort"
    #:    notice for a request the user never made.
    #:    *Denied in* ``SessionStreamFn.__call__``: the isolated branch returns
    #:    before the classification.
    #: 4. The quota preflight can block a credential and activate a fallback
    #:    route for the whole session.
    #:    *Denied in* ``SessionStreamFn.__call__``: same early return, which is
    #:    also what leaves ``_message_boundary_pending`` unspent (the preflight
    #:    is what clears it).
    #: 5. The session's prompt cache key identifies a request PREFIX. A naming
    #:    call's prefix is a different system block, so sharing the key buys no
    #:    hit and writes a competing entry under the turn's name.
    #:    *Denied in* ``SessionStreamFn.__call__``: same early return, so the
    #:    key is never copied onto the request.
    #: 6. The credential CASCADE mutates routing state on what looks like a
    #:    read: ``AuthStore._resolve`` blocks an OAuth row whose refresh raises
    #:    (so ``_usable_key_rows`` hides it from every later resolve, and the
    #:    turn re-resolves on each tool-loop request) and writes or clears the
    #:    session's sticky credential on the way through its tiers. A transient
    #:    failure on the token endpoint during a title call could therefore
    #:    block the credential the turn is transacting on and repoint stickiness
    #:    to a sibling — the "cold cache prefix, alternating identity headers"
    #:    failure ``create_stream_fn`` warns about. This one is upstream of both
    #:    switches above, so neither reaches it.
    #:    *Denied in* ``_resolve_access_for_provider``, which passes
    #:    ``read_only=request.isolated`` into ``get_oauth_access`` /
    #:    ``get_api_key`` → ``AuthStore._resolve``: no ``block_credential``, no
    #:    ``_set_sticky`` write and none cleared.
    #:
    #: So an isolated request gets at most TWO AUTH attempts on the model it
    #: names, and the second only in one case: the bearer it was handed was
    #: rejected outright (401/403) and a read-only re-resolve that hides that
    #: rejected ROW produces a different bearer. (Auth attempts, because the
    #: pre-existing fast-mode-refusal re-ask is not gated on the retry budget
    #: and can add one same-key attempt at standard speed ahead of this one.)
    #: Deployment reality widened the original
    #: one-attempt rule: pools contain stale keys, the pick is a hash of the
    #: session id, and the turn beside the errand rotates past the dead row on
    #: its own — so without the re-resolve, every naming call for such a
    #: session would fail forever while the conversation itself stayed healthy.
    #: The errand spends one extra request only in that auth case. Everything
    #: else holds: no fallback chain, no sticky route read or written, no
    #: credential rotation, no backoff sleep, no preflight, no boundary
    #: classification, no routing decision taken by its credential resolve,
    #: and not the session's cache key. It still resolves credentials under
    #: the session id, so that READ lands on the same account the turn is on
    #: whenever that account is usable, which is the point. What it cannot do
    #: is take the turn anywhere: if its own resolve finds the sticky
    #: credential's refresh broken it may serve ITSELF from a sibling, but the
    #: sticky pointer and the block list come out of the call exactly as they
    #: went in, so the turn's next resolve still lands where it did before. A
    #: successful OAuth refresh does persist the rotated token, which is that
    #: account's own bookkeeping rather than a decision about where requests
    #: go. It fails fast and alone, which is what lets the caller swallow the
    #: failure (see ``session.naming.generate_title``) without the turn ever
    #: knowing a second call happened.
    #:
    #: Enforced in three places, tested in three: ``stream_with_failover``
    #: (1, 2, and the retry budget), ``SessionStreamFn.__call__`` (3, 4, 5) and
    #: the read-only resolve (6). That the naming call actually SETS this flag
    #: is tested separately, over a real ``Session`` and a capturing stream fn.
