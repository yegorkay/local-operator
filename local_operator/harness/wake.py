"""Scheduled wakes — built around a pure schedule layer plus a live
``WakeScheduler``.

Splits cleanly into a pure layer (shape, parsing, recurrence math — zero
timers) and a live layer (:class:`WakeScheduler`, which owns the schedules and
a single armed timer). Persistence lives in the session transcript as a
``wake_schedules`` custom entry, handled by the caller via the ``persist``
callback; this module never touches disk.

Key semantics carried over from the reference scheduler:

- ``parse_wake_duration`` REJECTS bare numbers (``60`` reads as both seconds
  and milliseconds; guessing wrong is a runaway loop) but ACCEPTS compounds
  (``8h30m``): summing unit-suffixed terms has no such ambiguity.
- Missed occurrences are SKIPPED, not replayed: a laptop asleep six hours owes
  one hourly check, not six. The skip is not silent, though — on a resume that
  adopts overdue schedules, :meth:`WakeScheduler.take_missed` reports how many
  occurrences each schedule skipped so the delivery can say "this wake fired
  late, N occurrences were missed" instead of impersonating a punctual one.
- ``build_wake_schedule`` returns the error as a STRING rather than raising, so
  the tool's failure path is a sentence the model can act on.
- ``MAX_ARM_MS`` caps the armed timer at one minute; long-dated wakes re-check
  the wall clock on a tick so sleep/clock-skew/timezone changes are absorbed.
- asyncio has no ``timer.unref()`` — the scheduler MUST be :meth:`disposed
  <WakeScheduler.dispose>` explicitly so a pending wake never keeps the event
  loop alive.
