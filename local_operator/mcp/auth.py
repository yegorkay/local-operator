"""MCP OAuth support on the official SDK's ``OAuthClientProvider``.

Flow (official SDK PKCE + RFC 7591 DCR under the hood):

- ``build_oauth_provider(server_url, cfg)`` is the entry point: it wires the
  provider AND primes it with the stored token's expiry, which is what makes a
  restart spend the refresh token instead of re-running a browser grant.
- ``ensure_mcp_oauth_fresh(server_url, cfg)`` refreshes an expired access
  token BEFORE connecting, against the token endpoint resolved from the
  server's OAuth metadata (PRM + ASM discovery). This is what stops a day-old
  token from forcing a browser grant on startup for providers whose token
  endpoint is not ``<server_base>/token`` (the SDK's fallback guess 404s for
  e.g. Datadog). The refresh is serialized across processes with a file lock,
  and the exchange task OWNS that lock from its acquire to its store write —
  the connect only passes the handle over — so a cancelled or over-budget
  connect cannot free it while the POST is still on the wire, and the token is
  re-read under it, so concurrently starting sessions cannot spend a rotating
  refresh token twice.
- ``wire_oauth_auth(server_url, cfg)`` returns the ``OAuthClientProvider``
  kwargs: client metadata with a loopback redirect URI, a token storage bound
  to the shared credential store, and a :class:`LoopbackAuthFlow` that
  actually LISTENS on that redirect URI (with a pasted-URL race for browsers
  that cannot reach this machine).
- ``McpTokenStorage`` is the SDK ``TokenStorage``: one row per server URL in
  the real ``providers.auth_store.AuthStore``, keyed ``mcp_oauth:<url>``, with
  the token's issue time recorded so its lifetime survives the process.

Non-interactive connects (ordinary startup and auto-reconnect) pass
``interactive=False``: when the stored grant cannot be refreshed the flow
raises :class:`McpAuthRequiredError` instead of opening a browser, and the
manager surfaces that as an actionable "run /mcp login <name>" failure. Only
an explicit login (``/mcp login`` / ``local-operator mcp login``) runs
interactive and may open a browser.

Credential mapping onto the REAL AuthStore API (MCP-03): the store is keyed
by integer row id + ``provider`` column + ``identity_key``, so the logical
credential id ``mcp_oauth:<server_url>`` maps to ``provider='mcp-oauth'`` +
``identity_key=<server_url>`` (carried through the payload's ``project_id``
field, which the store's dedupe logic picks up). Reads filter
``list_credentials('mcp-oauth')`` by ``identity_key``; writes go through
``upsert_credential``, which updates the row in place on re-auth.

#: log nobody reads. A settings page that cannot say "we opened your browser" or
#: offer the link when no browser opened leaves the user staring at a spinner.
#: A context variable rather than a constructor argument because the flow is
#: built deep inside the manager's connect path; the operation task sets it and

#: 33441 is deliberately rare (sibling of Codex's 33418): :3000 collides with

TOKENS_OBTAINED_AT_KEY = "tokens_obtained_at"

#: Payload key that gives the stored grant an IDENTITY, as distinct from the
#: timestamps that only say when something was written. Value is
#: ``{"issued_at": <float>, "attested_at": <float>}``.
#:
#: Why a second field is needed at all: ``tokens_obtained_at`` is moved by BOTH
#: writers that can produce a grant — an interactive login (a NEW chain) and our
#: own refresh rotation (the SAME chain) — so "the row got newer" cannot tell a
#: peer's ``/mcp reauth`` from a rotation this process performed itself. The
#: retry decision needs that distinction in BOTH directions: a peer's new grant
#: must lift an auth block (a block taken against a grant we never presented is
#: unfalsifiable, and the server then stays dead on a perfectly good
#: credential), while our own rotation must not (an attempt that re-arms its own
#: block spends a refresh token per tick, in every process, against a provider
#: where re-presenting a rotated token can revoke the whole family — see
#: :data:`GRANT_DEAD_AT_KEY`). Measured before this key existed, two real
#: processes over one ``auth.db``: 31 rotations per process over 30 polls.
#:
#: The stamp is CARRIED, never minted. :meth:`McpTokenStorage.store_refresh_result`
#: copies the row's previous chain stamp forward, so a rotation continues the
#: chain it came from; :meth:`McpTokenStorage.set_tokens` POPS the key, because an
#: interactive grant is a new chain by definition and nothing else may remove it.
#:
#: Why a PAIR rather than just ``issued_at``: the write that mints the stamp also
#: records ``attested_at``, the ``tokens_obtained_at`` that same write produced.
#: It is what makes a pair self-describing ("this chain was the row's chain when
#: the row said this") and what a future rule about stale pairs would need. The
#: READ does not consult it — see the F rule below, and
#: :func:`_chain_stamp_of` — deliberately: any rule input a chain-unaware writer
#: can move is a rule input a chain-unaware writer can storm on.
#:
#: THE F RULE, and why attestation is not a rule input. The stamp is
#: ``issued_at`` whenever the row carries a readable pair, and the raw
#: ``tokens_obtained_at`` ONLY when the pair is ABSENT (a legacy row, or our own
#: :meth:`McpTokenStorage.set_tokens` pop). A STALE pair is deliberately not read
#: as a chain change. The previous revision did read it that way, on the claim
#: that such a write "costs ONE unearned retry and never a storm" — that claim
#: is FALSE, and the reason is that a chain-unaware writer is a PROCESS, not one
#: write. A real old build moves ``tokens_obtained_at`` on every rotation and
#: leaves the pair behind; the new side then read each of its rotations as a new
#: grant and retried, and the old side read each of the new side's rotations as
#: movement in turn, so the two fed each other. Measured, two real processes over
#: one ``auth.db``, 30 polls each, rotations per process — **main+main: 2/1**;
#: **main+head: 26/26** (independently reproduced by the reviewer at 27/27,
#: 21/21, 14/14 and by QA at 14/14, 12/11); **head+head: 1/1**; and with this
#: rule **main+this tree: 1/1**. At the production 60 s poll that is one refresh
#: POST per minute per process for every server blocked in BOTH versions, for the
#: whole rollout window, on every release.
#:
#: The price of the F rule is one cell, recorded rather than argued away: a grant
#: replaced IN PLACE by an old build's ``/mcp login`` is invisible to a new-build
#: peer, because that writer leaves the pair as it found it and the stamp
#: therefore does not move. It is narrow and it is mixed-fleet only — an old
#: build's ``/mcp reauth`` CLEARS the row (the pair goes with it, so the stamp
#: moves to ``0.0`` and the heal happens), a new-build login or reauth heals, and
#: an old build's rotation proves nothing either way — and it ends when the last
#: old process restarts. The alternative (a retry on any ``tokens_obtained_at``
#: movement, rate-limited or not) keeps the reciprocal loop alive at a lower rate,
#: spending a rotation per window per blocked server against a credential that
#: may be dead, which is worse than 0.
#:
#: Not secret-derived, deliberately: both floats are copies of a wall-clock stamp
#: the row already holds, in the same ``data`` column of the same row, under the
#: same readers. Nothing here is a token, a digest or anything derived from one
#: (unlike :data:`GRANT_UNCONFIRMED_SEND_KEY`'s digest).
#:
#: Contract — only these two writers may touch it, and adding a third is how
#: this whole mechanism breaks: ``mark_grant_dead``,
#: ``mark_send_unconfirmed``, ``clear_send_unconfirmed``, ``set_client_info``,
#: ``seed_client_info``, ``clear`` and ``_write`` must NOT write, move or remove
#: this key. Each of them can run during a rotation-free write (``wire_oauth_auth``
#: re-seeds ``client_info`` on EVERY connect, the send marker is armed around
#: one POST), so a write there would move the marker without a new grant,
#: re-arming a block nobody earned a retry on. The ``set_tokens`` pop is not
#: optional either — see that method, where it is the only thing that stops a new
#: interactive grant from inheriting the failed chain's stamp.
GRANT_CHAIN_KEY = "grant_chain"

#: Payload key holding POSITIVE evidence that a connect STOOD UP on the grant
#: this row holds. Value is ``{"at": <epoch seconds>, "chain": <float>}``, where
#: ``chain`` is the chain stamp the successful connect ran on and ``at`` is when
#: the witness was written.
#:
#: Why positive evidence is needed on top of a chain stamp, which cannot
#: substitute for it: :data:`GRANT_CHAIN_KEY` can only ever say the grant was
#: REPLACED, and a refresh rotation — including a sibling process's, and
#: including one performed while a temporary provider-side rejection is on —
#: CARRIES the chain forward. So a session blocked by a transient 401 sees a chain
#: that never moves while the credential demonstrably works elsewhere. Measured
#: (QA round 1, Q1; real processes, a real authorization server and a real
#: ``AuthStore``): the blocked session stayed ``auth-required`` through 60 polls
#: while its sibling connected and served a request. ``main`` healed that case,
#: and it healed it only because EVERY blocked session retried on every tick —
#: which is the family-revoking storm this subsystem exists to prevent (measured
#: on ``main``, two real processes: 17/17 and 8/8 rotations per process over 30
#: polls). The heal therefore has to rest on a fact about the chain WORKING, not
#: on the row changing.
#:
#: Why that cannot decay into a timer, which is the objection any retry must
#: answer: a witness VALUE exists only because some connect succeeded, and a
#: successful connect clears that session's own block
#: (``_register_connection`` → ``_clear_auth_block``). The retry rule is "a
#: witness NEWER than the one this attempt consumed", so a session woken by a
#: witness either heals and stops polling, or fails and writes no witness of its
#: own; retries are bounded by EVENTS, not by ticks. Measured: 6 witness values
#: bought 6 retries over 60 polls rather than 60, a stale or already-consumed
#: value buys nothing, and two blocked sessions plus one success cost one extra
#: attempt each with no ping-pong.
#:
#: NOT secret-derived, exactly like the chain stamp: two wall-clock floats on the
#: same row, in the same ``data`` column, under the same readers. Nothing here is
#: a token, a digest, or anything derived from one, so this key cannot leak
#: anything the row does not already hold.
#:
#: Only :meth:`McpTokenStorage.record_grant_ok` writes it, and that write happens
#: ONLY after a connect stood up end to end (the transport entered, the session
#: initialized, the tools listed) and is conditioned on the row not having moved
#: underneath it — a whole-payload read-modify-write that skipped that compare
#: would put a SPENT refresh token back. A failure writes nothing, because a
#: failed connect is evidence about nothing.
#:
#: Residual loss, stated here rather than discovered later: if EVERY session is
#: blocked, nobody connects, so nobody writes a witness and the block stands until
#: a session stands up or the operator re-auths. That is not a regression against
#: this feature's own head (which behaved identically) but it is not what ``main``
#: did; the fix would be a periodic resource-side probe, which puts a network
#: request on a timer in every blocked session and needs a never-refresh mode in
#: the auth flow, and it is deliberately not in this change.
GRANT_OK_KEY = "grant_ok"

#: Payload key marking THIS row's refresh token as one the authorization server
#: has already rejected with ``invalid_grant``. Set only by the parsed-body
#: branch in :func:`_refresh_oauth_token_locked`; absence means "no such
#: observation", never "known good".
#:
#: Why this exists: nothing used to record the rejection, so every process boot
#: re-spent the same dead token (measured: 39 POSTs for one server, 87 for
#: another, across 26 boots). For a provider running refresh-token REUSE
#: DETECTION (Notion) that is not merely waste — re-presenting an already-rotated
#: token revokes the ENTIRE token family, so a burst of session spawns turns one
#: stale row into a fleet-wide logout.
#:
#: Why NO ttl: a dead grant is a CORRECTNESS fact that stays true until an
#: interactive login replaces the grant, not a cost backoff. This is also why it
#: is not stored in ``auth_credential_blocks``: ``block_credential`` clamps every
#: block to ``MAX_CREDENTIAL_BLOCK_MS`` (1h), a ceiling that is load-bearing for
#: provider quota backoff, so reusing that table would resume the storm — and the
#: family revocation — every hour. That table is also keyed by integer
#: ``credential_id`` plus a ``provider:type`` composite, where an MCP grant's
#: identity is its ``server_url``. Wrong lifetime, wrong key.
#:
#: Living in the row payload makes it atomic with the grant it describes:
#: :meth:`McpTokenStorage.clear` deletes it with the row, and
#: :meth:`McpTokenStorage.set_tokens` clears it on an INTERACTIVE token write, so
#: there is no way to leave a tombstone pointing at a token that no longer
#: exists. It needs no migration — the payload already round-trips unknown keys.
#:
#: :meth:`McpTokenStorage.store_refresh_result` deliberately does NOT clear it.
#: Only an interactive grant (login/reauth) may un-dead a grant: a token minted
#: by a refresh belongs to the family the marker says the authorization server
#: revoked, so a late refresh response landing after a tombstone must leave the
#: grant reading DEAD rather than resurrect it.
GRANT_DEAD_AT_KEY = "grant_dead_at"

#: Payload key recording that THIS row's refresh token was PRESENTED by an
#: exchange whose outcome never arrived — the request may have been written and
#: the token spent, and re-presenting a spent token is the reuse-detection POST
#: that revokes the whole family. Value is
#: ``{"digest": <short digest of the presented token>, "at": <epoch seconds>}``.
#:
#: Why a DIGEST rather than the token: the marker only ever answers "is the
#: token in this row the one an exchange is unsure about?", and a digest keeps
#: the payload from carrying the same live credential twice. It is not a
#: confidentiality measure — the token itself lives in the same row.
#:
#: Why it is ARMED BEFORE THE POST: a process that dies mid-request takes its
#: in-memory knowledge with it, and the next boot would present a token that may
#: already be spent. The write-ahead marker is the only channel that survives
#: that death. The price is a false positive in the narrow window between the
#: arm and the wire, which is why the marker EXPIRES
#: (:data:`UNCONFIRMED_SEND_TTL_S`) and why a connect-phase failure clears it.
GRANT_UNCONFIRMED_SEND_KEY = "grant_refresh_unconfirmed"

#: Outcome of one refresh attempt. Multi-valued rather than ``bool`` because each
#: refusal has its OWN truthful user-visible message (lock contention, a budget
#: overrun, a server that answered without a token, a token endpoint that could
#: not be reached, a token that was never sent because the row held nothing to
#: present, a possibly-spent token needing a fresh sign-in) and because the
#: coordinator must tell a DEAD grant (never present this token again) from a
#: merely FAILED one (transient; today's behaviour is correct).
#: CAUTION: every member is a truthy string — every call site must compare
#: against a member explicitly, never test truthiness.

@dataclass
class RefreshSendState:
    """What one exchange knows about ITS OWN request's progress.

    ``send_started`` flips in the httpx request EVENT HOOK that arms the
    write-ahead send marker. That hook runs in ``_send_handling_redirects``
    BEFORE ``_send_single_request`` reaches the transport (httpx 0.28.1:
    ``_client.py:1691`` against ``:1717``/``:1728``), so the flag means exactly
    one thing: httpx was HANDED this request and began sending it.

    It is NOT evidence that a byte reached the wire. Everything httpx does
    between that hook and the socket — the pool queue, DNS, TCP, TLS — happens
    after the flag flips, so a cancellation in any of them leaves it ``True``
    and the marker armed, identically to the arm this replaced (reviewer round
    1, R1-2, measured on this tree). The first revision of this change claimed
    otherwise; the claim is withdrawn rather than the behaviour being faked,
    because httpx exposes no observable "the bytes are on the wire" seam short
    of socket-level surgery.

    The two readings are deliberately asymmetric, and that asymmetry is the
    whole value:

    * ``False`` is CONCLUSIVE, and it is the direction the refusal policy needs:
      no request was ever handed to the client, so this exchange cannot have
      spent the token and cannot have lost a rotation in flight. Nothing gets
      quarantined for a request that was never built.
    * ``True`` is CONSERVATIVE, never optimistic: it covers both "on the wire"
      and "cancelled in the connect phase", which is the distinction the
      14-hour incident could not make from its logs (design audit Q1). An arm a
      tick too early costs a browser sign-in; one a tick too late risks
      re-presenting a spent token, the reuse-detection POST that revokes the
      family.

    What the move to the hook bought is therefore narrow and is stated as such
    here: the marker is never armed LATER than the request hook (safety-neutral),
    and the log says what is observable instead of overstating it. It does NOT
    remove the connect-phase cancellation class, and no test or comment in this
    module may claim that it does.

    Deliberately NOT persisted: it describes a live task, and the row already
    carries the durable half (the marker itself). One instance per exchange,
    created by :func:`_refresh_oauth_token_locked`, handed to
    :func:`_perform_refresh_exchange` and kept by
    :func:`_detach_refresh_exchange` so the exchange's own settle line can name
    the state after the connect that started it has gone.

#: Refresh this far BEFORE the stored access token's deadline. A connect that
#: starts with a token dying in ten seconds would otherwise open with a 401 and

#: refresh grant proactively keeps the first request authenticated.
REFRESH_SKEW_S = 60.0

#: Bound on one proactive refresh's HTTP round trips (metadata discovery plus
#: the token POST). A slow authorization server must not park the connect —
#: the startup gate defers us, and the breaker bounds retries.
REFRESH_HTTP_TIMEOUT_S = 10.0

#: How long PAST the refresh budget a token response is still accepted and
#: persisted. What it bounds, precisely: the response READ of the exchange task
#: once the connect that started it has given up waiting. It is not a connect
#: budget. The exchange still OWNS the refresh lock while this grace runs (the
#: lock is acquired and released INSIDE the exchange task — see
#: :func:`_perform_refresh_exchange` — precisely so a waiter's cancellation or
#: timeout cannot free it mid-POST), so a holder's critical section is bounded by
#: ``REFRESH_HTTP_TIMEOUT_S + REFRESH_LATE_RESPONSE_GRACE_S``; that is longer
#: than ``LOCK_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_S``, deliberately, and the derivation comment
#: there states why giving up instead of waiting is safe. A CANCELLED connect
#: detaches immediately and never waits for this grace, so teardown latency is
#: not paid out of the budget any more.
#:
#: Finite on purpose: a server that never answers must not leave a task reading
#: a socket for the life of the process.
REFRESH_LATE_RESPONSE_GRACE_S = 30.0

#: How long a teardown waits for DETACHED refresh exchanges to persist their
#: rotation (see :func:`drain_refresh_exchanges`).
#:
#: Why this number is small, and why the wait is a CUT rather than a join: the
#: exchange's own budget is ``REFRESH_HTTP_TIMEOUT_S`` plus
#: ``REFRESH_LATE_RESPONSE_GRACE_S`` (40 s), and the exit paths that pay this
#: wait are quiescent (idle-exit, a signal drain, a quit) where a couple of
#: seconds is invisible — but a TUI or CLI quit must never visibly hang on an
#: authorization server that has stopped answering. So the bound is chosen to
#: cover the ordinary case (a rotation already on its way back, measured in
#: tens of milliseconds against a local endpoint and a second or two against a
#: remote issuer) and to give up loudly on the rest: hitting the bound is LOGGED
#: rather than silently tolerated, because a rotation that outlives it is the
#: loss this drain exists to remove.
REFRESH_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_S = 2.5

#: Every refresh exchange currently running DETACHED from the connect that
#: started it, i.e. one whose awaiter has cancelled or timed out while the POST
#: stayed on the wire (``_detach_refresh_exchange`` adds, the exchange's own done
#: callback discards). Process-wide rather than per-session on purpose: the task
#: is created inside the exchange, which knows nothing about sessions, and a
#: teardown that waits a moment too long for a sibling's exchange is harmless
#: while a rotation lost to a store closing under it is not. It is the ONLY
#: handle on such a task — the connect that would have awaited it is gone — so
#: :func:`drain_refresh_exchanges` reads it to keep the credential store open
#: until the rotations still in flight have landed.
_DETACHED_REFRESH_EXCHANGES: set["asyncio.Task[RefreshOutcome]"] = set()

#: How long a "presented but unacknowledged" send marker stays live (see
#: :data:`GRANT_UNCONFIRMED_SEND_KEY`).
#:
#: The marker exists to stop us re-presenting a token an exchange may already
#: have spent, and the price of believing it is one interactive sign-in, so it
#: must be BOUNDED. A marker armed in the window between the marker write and
#: the request reaching the wire (a crash, a refused connection) describes a
#: token nothing ever presented, and a marker that never expired would suppress
#: that server's refresh until the user happened to re-auth — the "bricked
#: server" failure mode. An hour covers a restart, a slow session or a user who
#: stepped away, and after it lapses we present the stored token again, which is
#: exactly the behaviour every boot had BEFORE this marker existed. So the
#: expiry can only degrade to the status quo ante, never to something worse.
UNCONFIRMED_SEND_TTL_S = 3600.0

#: Why a refresh was refused — ONE STABLE CODE per truthfully different
#: situation. This block is the SEAM the user-visible wording hangs off: the auth
#: layer carries the code on the exception (:attr:`McpRefreshContendedError`'s
#: ``reason_code`` / :attr:`McpAuthRequiredError.reason_code`) and the manager —
#: the only layer that knows the server's NAME — composes the short rendered
#: text from it (:meth:`McpManager._auth_failure_text`). Nothing here is copy.
#:
#: The split exists because one sentence covered all of these and was therefore
#: untrue on most of them. A first attempt at splitting reworded the verbose
#: sentence instead, which does not work at any terminal width: that sentence
#: opens with ``MCP OAuth token refresh for <full server URL>``, which is ~55 of
#: a 58-cell toast card, so the distinguishing clause was always the part
#: tail-truncated away and all three refusals rendered byte-identically at 100
#: columns and below (design review D1/D2). A CODE travels independently of the
#: sentence, so the rendered text can be short while the sentence stays verbose
#: where verbose is right — ``str(exc)`` and the logs.
#:
#: The set is closed and short: the manager re-voices a transport-mangled
#: cancellation from these and the tests assert the mapped copy verbatim.
#:
#: * ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_LOCK`` — no exclusivity, so nothing was presented; another
#:   session is refreshing this grant right now.
#: * ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_INFLIGHT`` — the exchange outran the connect's budget and
#:   is still running; a late rotation will still be persisted.
#: * ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_ENDPOINT`` — the exchange ran and the authorization
#:   server's answer carried no usable token.
#: * ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_UNREACHABLE`` — the request never reached the wire (httpx's
#:   own pre-send taxonomy, see :func:`_refresh_request_never_sent`), so nothing
#:   was presented and there is no rotation to keep. Split out of
#:   ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_ENDPOINT`` deliberately: an unreachable endpoint is not a
#:   server that rejected us, and saying it was (review round 2, minor 1) tells
#:   the user the grant was refused when the request never left the machine.
#: * ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_UNCONFIRMED`` — a token may already be spent (it was
#:   presented, or an earlier presentation was never acknowledged), so nothing
#:   may be presented until an interactive grant replaces it.
#: * ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_UNSENT`` — the exchange ran and found nothing it could
#:   present (no stored refresh token, or no client registration to authenticate
#:   with), so NO request was made. It has its own code because the
#:   ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_ENDPOINT`` text ("the server returned no token") is false
#:   about both the wire and the server for a request that never left the
#:   machine (review round 3, M2).
#: * ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_UNATTRIBUTED`` — a failure of our OWN coordination (a
#:   re-read that raised, a lock that could never be taken, the post-condition
#:   finding nothing usable) which cannot be attributed to a server answer at
#:   all. Same reason as ``UNSENT`` for existing: the honest statement names no
#:   server, so no server may be blamed for it.

#: (40s), which EXCEEDS this bound. That inversion is deliberate and safe, and
#: it is why this constant can no longer be derived as "longer than the work".
#: A waiter that gives up here does not proceed unlocked: it takes the contended
#: path (strip the in-memory refresh token, raise
#: :class:`McpRefreshContendedError`), which the manager retries on its backoff
#: ladder, and the holder's rotation still reaches the store. Presenting a

    """An MCP server needs an interactive OAuth grant this run cannot open.

    Raised instead of opening a browser when the connect is NON-interactive
    (ordinary session startup and auto-reconnects): a background connect that
    pops a login tab is an interruption the user never asked for, and several
    sessions starting at once would each pop one. The connect fails with an
    actionable message instead; ``/mcp login <name>`` (or
    ``local-operator mcp login <name>``) runs the same grant deliberately.

    ``detail`` names WHY the grant is unusable when the reason is specific
    enough to be worth telling the user — today only a token refresh that was
    SENT but never confirmed (:class:`McpRefreshUnconfirmedError`). The
    manager's ``_auth_required_text`` renders it as the tail of the actionable
    line, so the command still comes first. ``None`` (the default) keeps the
    app's house wording for a dead credential (``sign-in expired``), which is
    the truthful summary for every other route into this error: the stored grant
    could not be refreshed.

    ``log_detail`` is the SEPARATE sentence for ``str(self)`` when the rendered
    tail has to be shorter than the technical fact (review round 3, N3).
    ``detail`` is what a user reads on a card that clamps it twice; ``str()``
    feeds the logs, where the mechanism is the thing support needs. The two
    audiences were separated deliberately by the reason-code seam, and collapsing
    them back into one string is what made a shortened tail also shorten the log
    line.

    ``reason_code`` is the STABLE CODE for why (:data:`REFRESH_REFUSAL_LOCK` and
    friends), and it is the seam user-visible copy is composed from: the manager
    maps the code to short rendered text, while ``str(self)`` keeps the verbose
    technical sentence for the logs. ``None`` means "no more specific reason than
    an unusable grant". See the ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_*`` block for why the copy is
    not carried here as prose.

    rotated refresh token — the family-revoking request this subsystem exists to
    prevent. Deliberately NOT a subclass of :class:`McpAuthRequiredError` and
    deliberately never raised for a grant that is known dead: this is a
    transient outcome, so the manager's generic reconnect arm retries it with
    backoff and never takes an auth block on it. The in-memory refresh token is
    stripped before the raise (see
    ``_RefreshCoordinatingOAuthProvider._refuse_unlocked_refresh``) so the
    suppressed SDK refresh cannot run either way.

    One verbose SENTENCE per reason, and one stable CODE: the code is what the
    manager turns into user-visible text (this string opens with the server's
    full URL and is ~55 cells before it says anything distinguishing, so it can
    never be the rendered copy — see the ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_*`` block), while the
    sentence below stays for ``str(exc)`` and the logs, where the URL and the
    wording are exactly what a maintainer wants. The sentences also deliberately
    do NOT promise a retry: the mid-session reconnect path does retry with
    backoff, but the startup gate schedules none, so the log sentence may not
    claim one either.

    This type reaches the manager INDIRECTLY. The MCP streamable-HTTP transport
    runs the request inside anyio cancel scopes, so an exception raised out of
    the auth flow is not delivered — it arrives at ``_connect_server`` as a bare
    ``CancelledError('Cancelled via cancel scope …')``. The provider therefore
    arms :data:`REFRESH_CONTENTION` immediately before raising, and the manager
    re-voices exactly that cancellation as this error. Callers that drive
    ``async_auth_flow`` without the transport (tests, and any future in-process
    caller) see the raise itself.

        The refresh path used to write through :meth:`set_tokens`, which is
        unconditional, so a response that landed after a later, better-informed
        verdict overwrote it. Two measured consequences, both the reuse-storm
        this module exists to prevent: a detached exchange's late HTTP 200
        cleared a tombstone another exchange had just written (a revoked family
        reading ALIVE, so every later boot re-POSTed it), and the same late write
        erased a rotation a peer had persisted in between. An error BEFORE this
        path could not fix it either: with two slow exchanges the tombstone's own
        compare-and-skip saw the row moved and never wrote the marker at all,
        because the row it inspected had itself been moved by an exchange the
        revocation invalidated.

        So the write re-reads the row immediately before writing and persists
        only while the payload still holds the refresh token THIS exchange
        presented.

        A row that is gone ENTIRELY is treated as the same fact, not as licence
        to re-create: an explicitly removed row stays removed, so a `/mcp logout`
        or a `/mcp reauth` that lands while our exchange is in flight is never
        silently undone by a refresh that was already on the wire (QA round 2,
        Q6). This used to re-create the row on the stated reasoning that
        "absence is not evidence that somebody replaced the grant" — and that
        half is still true, which is why the three-valued
        :meth:`has_stored_row` decides it: a DEFINITE absence is an act by
        another writer and this write is dropped with an INFO line naming the
        writer and the reason, while an UNREADABLE store
        (:meth:`has_stored_row` returns ``None``) is not evidence of removal
        either and keeps the old behaviour, the rotation is still written. That
        direction is deliberate and is the one the family's safety rests on: a
        rotation we drop while the spent token stays in the row is re-presented
        by the next refresh, which is the reuse-detecting POST that revokes
        every session. Dropping a rotation costs at most one interactive
        sign-in; keeping a spent token costs the whole family.

        This is now symmetric with :meth:`mark_grant_dead`, which declines to
        write on a payload that no longer holds the token it rejected. Two
        writers racing a removal must give the same answer, and before this fix
        they gave opposite ones.

        Two disciplines separate this from :meth:`set_tokens`:

        * the dead-grant marker is NEVER cleared here. Only an interactive grant
          may un-dead a grant; a refresh-derived token is exactly the thing the
          marker says the authorization server revoked, so clearing it would
          resurrect a family it has already killed. The write still happens —
          the rotation is real and worth keeping for support — and the marker
          keeps it from ever being presented.
        * a dropped write is logged at INFO, naming this writer and the reason.
          A lost rotation is what support has to be able to read out of the log
          after an incident; it is never a debug detail.

        The first-grant path is unaffected: ``set_tokens`` still creates the row
        for a completed interactive grant. A refresh can only ever run against a
        row that already held the token it presented, so absence here always
        means a REMOVAL that raced us, never a first grant.

        A NEW CHAIN MUST GO THROUGH :meth:`set_tokens`, never through here. This
        method is the only writer that CARRIES a chain stamp forward
        (:data:`GRANT_CHAIN_KEY`), so an interactive grant routed through it
        would be classified as a continuation of the chain the session failed
        on. The cost is a missed heal (the block stays, no storm) — it fails
        safe, which is why the funnel split is documented here rather than
        enforced.

        The return value is NOT acted on by its only caller,
        (:func:`_perform_refresh_exchange` discards it and reports
        ``"refreshed"`` either way — see the comment at that call), so what a
        dropped write buys the operator is the INFO line above and nothing more.
        That is still a real gain: the row keeps the presented (spent) token with
        the write-ahead marker armed, so the next refresh refuses on it exactly as
        the refusal policy always did, instead of a drop being indistinguishable
        from a success. Turning the drop into its own ``RefreshOutcome`` would
        change what every caller of the exchange switches on — the refusal and
        marker path — which is deliberately out of this change's scope (reviewer
        round 1, R1-3). No caller consumes it: the only call site discards it,
        and this module's tests pin the INFO line rather than the return value.

        Caller: :func:`_perform_refresh_exchange`, which holds the refresh lock
        across this call, so the only writers it races are the ones that
        deliberately do not take the lock (a completed interactive login, the
        SDK's client-info writes, a `/mcp logout`).

        Returns ``True`` when the response was written, and ``False`` when the
        write was DROPPED — a case the previous contract could not express at
        all, because ``_write`` swallowed the failure while this method returned
        ``True`` unconditionally. That return is what d3 fixes; the paragraph
        above is the honest account of WHO reads it, and the answer is that the
        caller does not branch on it, so a drop reaches the operator through
        this method's own INFO line rather than through the caller's control
        flow.

        The identity of the grant currently stored for this server, read in ONE
        row fetch. Callers use it to answer "has somebody obtained a different
        grant since I last looked?" without caring what the grant is.

        The float is the CHAIN stamp (:func:`_chain_stamp_of`), not the row's
        raw ``tokens_obtained_at``: a refresh rotation carries its chain's stamp
        forward, so only a NEW grant — an interactive login, a logout, or a row
        removal — moves it. The distinction is what lets an auth block mean "the
        grant I failed on was replaced" instead of "the row got newer", which is
        the difference between a session that heals on a peer's ``/mcp reauth``
        and a fleet that re-arms its own block on every rotation it performs.

        ``witness_at`` is the THIRD element and it was added on purpose rather
        than bolted on: a chain stamp can only report a REPLACED grant, and a
        sibling's refresh continues the chain, so a session blocked by a
        temporary provider rejection needs positive evidence that the chain WORKS
        (:data:`GRANT_OK_KEY`). It is read from the SAME fetch as the other two,
        which is the property that matters — a witness read separately could
        describe a different instant than the stamp it is compared against, and
        the rule that consumes it compares exactly those two. ``None`` means the
        row carries no witness, which is every row written before this key
        existed and every row whose only activity has been failures; the retry
        rule may not move from it or to it.

        ``None`` means the store could not be read, and is deliberately NOT a
        tuple: a sentinel VALUE would compare unequal to the real marker either
        side of a transient failure, so an unreadable store would look exactly
        like a peer's re-auth. For a caller that retries on movement that turns
        a broken store into a refresh-token retry storm — which, against a
        provider running reuse detection, revokes the whole token family (see
        :data:`GRANT_DEAD_AT_KEY`). Unknown has to be representable as unknown.

        Read-only, and the single row read is the point: deriving both fields
        from one fetch costs a third of what calling ``_read_row`` and
        :meth:`grant_is_dead` separately does, and it means the two halves
        describe the SAME instant rather than two reads a write may fall
        between. The chain stamp is derived from that same fetch's payload for
        the same reason — a stamp read separately from the deadline it attests
        could straddle a rotation.

        It reads the store directly rather than through :meth:`_read_row`, which
        cannot serve this caller: ``_read_row`` deliberately converts a store
        FAILURE into the same ``None`` it returns for a row that is simply
        ABSENT, and every other caller wants that (a missing grant and an
        unreadable one both mean "start a fresh flow"). Here the two must stay
        distinguishable — absent is the stable, knowable marker ``(0.0, False)``
        that moves when a peer writes a grant, while unreadable is no
        information at all. Collapsing them is what turns a broken store into a

        ``rejected_refresh_token`` makes the FRESHNESS RE-READ a
        compare-and-skip, and it exists because the marker is a whole-payload
        read-modify-write: a sibling that persisted a fresh rotation between
        our read and our write otherwise had a live token rewritten as dead (or
        its token erased by our pre-rotation snapshot) and stayed suppressed
        until an interactive login. Re-reading here and writing only when the
        row still holds the token the server rejected keeps the write inside
        the window it was computed in. It mirrors the check-then-write
        convention ``providers.auth_store.AuthStore`` already uses, rather than
        introducing a second write primitive.

        Returns ``True`` when the marker was written, ``False`` when it was
        skipped or the write failed. A row removed underneath us (a racing
        ``/mcp logout``) is the ``False`` case, whatever the token argument: the
        removal is honoured, which is the answer its two sibling mutators give
        too (review round 3, M1).

        Its caller :func:`_perform_refresh_exchange` holds
        :func:`_oauth_refresh_lock` for the whole call, and writes through the
        same lock the FRESHNESS-conditioned sibling write uses
        (:meth:`store_refresh_result`), so the two can never disagree about
        which writer owns the grant; the remaining gap is against writers that
        deliberately do NOT take the lock — the interactive-login completion and
        the client-info writes that go through the SDK — so this narrows the
        window to the microseconds between the compare and the write instead of
        the whole exchange. The gap used to be bounded by
        :data:`REFRESH_LATE_RESPONSE_GRACE_S`, not by microseconds, because the
        detached exchange wrote with no lock at all; it does not any more.

        Deliberately does NOT touch :data:`GRANT_CHAIN_KEY`. A tombstone is a
        verdict about the chain the row already holds, not a new chain, so
        moving the chain stamp here would make a rejected grant look like a

        about its failure (a tombstone, a send marker) or a statement that it was
        replaced (the chain stamp). A session blocked over a temporary
        provider-side rejection has neither — a sibling's rotation carries the

        Why the write is CONDITIONED on ``tokens_obtained_at``: this is a
        whole-payload read-modify-write, like every other writer here, so a
        rotation landing between our read and our write would be undone by our
        snapshot. For a witness that means putting the SPENT refresh token back —
        the one thing a rotation is never allowed to lose, because the next
        refresh then re-presents it and a reuse-detecting provider revokes the
        whole family (see :data:`GRANT_DEAD_AT_KEY`). Re-reading and writing only
        when the timestamp is unchanged is the same check-then-write convention
        :meth:`mark_grant_dead` already uses, rather than a second write
        primitive. Skipping costs one witness, which buys nobody a retry and
        costs nobody a rotation. Guarded by
        ``test_the_success_witness_never_clobbers_a_racing_rotation``.

        Why it never raises: the witness exists for OTHER processes, and every
        caller is a connect that has already succeeded. A store failure here must
        not turn a working server into a failed connect, so it degrades to
        writing nothing — the same best-effort contract as the marker writes.

    a name the config does not know is a typo the user wants told about,

    "nothing was stored" outcome.

    """Remove ``name``'s credential for a REAUTH. ``None`` when the login may
    proceed, an error string when it must not.

    ``removed`` is an out-parameter appended to only when a row was genuinely
    deleted, mirroring ``run_grant``'s ``forgotten``. It exists because this
    function now returns ``None`` for TWO outcomes — a real deletion and a
    no-op on a server holding nothing — and a caller that warns "your
    credential is gone" after a cancelled grant must not say so for the second.

    Reauth's contract is "end up authenticated having genuinely re-granted",
    which needs a weaker precondition than logout's: logout must actually
    delete something, while reauth only needs to KNOW that nothing is left for
    the coming grant to reuse. A no-op delete satisfies that; a failed one does
    not. :func:`mcp_logout_server` reports both as an error string, so a caller
    branching on ``error is not None`` refuses the first case (the bug this PR
    fixes) and a caller branching on nothing at all accepts the second (a
    successful-looking reauth over a live credential).

    This function is the ONE place that distinction is made, so the CLI's
    ``mcp reauth`` and the TUI's ``/mcp reauth`` cannot answer it differently —
    two gates disagreeing about one question is the defect this PR exists to
    remove, and shipping it in a new place would only move it.

    The decision is structural at every step, never a string match on
    :func:`mcp_logout_server`'s human-readable message: that message is prose
    for a user, and reading control flow — security-relevant control flow — out
    of it would break silently the first time somebody rewords it.

    Three refusals survive, and each is re-made here rather than inherited:

    * an unknown name (``cfg is None``) is a typo, which must never turn into
      a browser tab;
    * a statically ineligible server (stdio, or a declared non-OAuth
      ``auth.type``) can never take a grant — the F3 protection;
    * a row that is STILL THERE after everything below has tried to remove it,
      because the next login would reuse it.

    The last case needs one extra step rather than only a check. A
    ``client_info``-only row is not a grant (:func:`payload_carries_grant`), so
    on a cold ledger it does not make the server ``server_is_oauth_capable``
    and :func:`mcp_logout_server` declines to touch it — yet it is exactly what
    short-circuits DCR and denies the user the fresh registration they ran
    reauth for. Reauth therefore removes it directly here: "delete what would
    be reused" IS reauth's contract, where logout's stricter "only remove a
    server we demonstrably hold something on" correctly protects the picker.
    No evidence is lost by that directness — this path is reachable only when
    the capability test was False, which for a readable row means it carried no
    grant, so :func:`mcp_logout_server` would have had nothing to transfer.

    signs in, the provider redirects, and the browser lands on
    ``ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`` with the code stranded in the address bar.

    The listener is opened in :meth:`redirect_handler`, BEFORE the browser is
    launched, because the provider can redirect the instant the user's session
    is already authorized — binding afterwards is a race the fast path loses.

    Paste is a strict FALLBACK, never a race: it is offered only when there is
    no listener to wait on. A thread parked in ``input()`` cannot be cancelled,
    so racing it would leave a reader on the tty and a thread that
    ``asyncio.run`` joins at shutdown — the browser path would succeed and the
    process would hang anyway. Paste is additionally gated on the terminal
    being ours: under the TUI it belongs to Textual's input driver, and a
    second reader on the same file descriptor does not queue behind it — the
    two split the user's keystrokes, which reads as an app randomly ignoring
    what is typed. :func:`~local_operator.logger.console_is_silenced` is the
    signal for that, and it also decides whether our progress notices go to
    stderr or to the log file.

# --- proactive OAuth refresh -------------------------------------------------

# Why this block exists: the SDK only refreshes a token INSIDE its 401 handler,
# and it derives the token endpoint from ``oauth_metadata`` — which a fresh
# process has not discovered yet, so the refresh falls back to
# ``urljoin(server_base, "/token")``. For providers whose token endpoint lives
# elsewhere (Datadog: ``https://us3.datadoghq.com/api/v2/oauth2/token``) that
# guess 404s, the refresh fails, and the SDK escalates to a FULL browser grant
# — the login tab popping up on every startup even though a valid refresh token
# sat in auth.db. The fix is to discover the real endpoints and spend the
# refresh token ourselves BEFORE the provider is built, race-free across the
# several sessions that start together.

    the caller then degrades to the SDK's own defaults (the pre-fix behavior)
    rather than failing the connect. Discovery is two unauthenticated GETs and
    only runs for OAuth servers, which are already the slow, deferred connects.

    Caching, and why a negative needed its own entry. Successful results were
    already cached per process. The ANSWERED NEGATIVE is now cached too, and
    that is the substantive half: ``_ensure_oauth_fresh`` reaches this once per
    CONNECT, and the connect path retries (backoff rungs, call-site retries,
    every session build in a fleet of children), so a server whose metadata
    discovery answers "I publish none" was re-probed on every attempt forever.
    Measured on the operator's real 8-server ``mcp.json``: 70 discovery calls
    during one cold prompt against 3 warm, ~184 ms cumulative CPU — for a
    question whose answer cannot change between two attempts milliseconds
    apart. The operator's own servers are mostly this case.

    A FAILED probe is still never cached. That is the distinction the cache
    turns on, and it is why :class:`_OAuthProbe` carries the verdict instead of
    both cases collapsing into ``None`` as they did: a transient failure must
    retry on the next connect, as it always has.

    ``force`` skips BOTH caches for one call. It exists for the explicit
    ``/mcp login`` gate (:func:`probe_oauth_capability`), where a human is
    deliberately asking the network a question: an answer a connect attempt
    recorded seconds earlier must not be silently substituted for it, and the
    cost is one round trip per deliberate login.

    Scope and bounds. Both caches are per PROCESS, keyed by server URL and
    capped at :data:`OAUTH_DISCOVERY_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` entries; the negative
    one additionally expires after :data:`OAUTH_DISCOVERY_NEGATIVE_TTL_S`
    (positives are stable metadata and stay for the process, as before). What

    non-OAuth server per TTL window for its whole life, however many sessions,
    reconnects and resumes run through it; a runtime child (each ``lop exec``,
    each subagent build) starts empty and pays ONE probe per server — the floor
    a process-local cache cannot go below. Sharing it across processes is
    deliberately not done: it would need a new on-disk artifact with its own
    staleness and isolation questions (see AGENTS.md on cache roots) to save
    the daemon's own children a round trip each.

    Keyed per server, because the race this lock exists to prevent is per

    A single global lock file also serialised servers that can never race each
    other, so one slow or unreachable provider parked every other server's
    connect behind it — with six OAuth servers and several concurrent sessions
    that is a queue nothing drains, and the observable symptom was two servers
    connecting and the rest sitting on "connecting" forever.

    The name is a SHA-256 digest of the URL rather than the URL itself: server
    URLs contain ``/``, ``:`` and query strings that are not filename-safe, and
    a digest is stable across runs and machines without any escaping scheme to
    keep in step. Truncated to 16 hex chars — this namespaces a handful of
    configured servers, not an adversarial keyspace.

    The pre-fix global ``mcp_oauth_refresh.lock`` is deliberately left in place
    and never cleaned up: another local-operator process running an older build
    may still be using it, and deleting a file that a live peer holds an flock
    on would silently drop that peer's mutual exclusion (its lock survives on
    the unlinked inode while a new process creates a fresh file and takes an
    uncontended lock). It is a zero-byte file; leaving it costs nothing.

    """Serialize the refresh exchange across processes for one server.

    Rotating refresh tokens make concurrent refreshes destructive: whichever
    process spends the current token second gets an error — or invalidates the
    first process's brand-new token. Holding an exclusive file lock around the
    exchange, and RE-READING the stored token after acquiring it, guarantees
    exactly one process performs the refresh no matter how many sessions start
    at once. The lock file lives next to ``auth.db``, is per server (see
    :func:`_oauth_refresh_lock_path`), and carries no state: it is only ever
    flocked, never read or written for content (on Windows it holds a single
    padding byte, which ``msvcrt.locking`` requires to have a range to lock).

    Yields a HANDLE that is truthy when the lock was taken and falsy when the
    bounded acquire gave up (see :class:`_OAuthRefreshLock`). A falsy body must
    still be SAFE to run, and that is now a narrower promise than "best-effort":
    it may NOT perform the refresh exchange, because an unexclusive exchange is
    the family-revoking double-spend this lock exists to prevent.
    :func:`ensure_mcp_oauth_fresh` can afford to skip the refresh on a falsy
    handle (its caller still connects and will re-read under the lock on the
    next attempt), and
    ``_RefreshCoordinatingOAuthProvider._coordinate_inflight_refresh`` must not
    fall through to the SDK's unlocked refresh either — it refuses with
    :class:`McpRefreshContendedError` instead. Blocking the connect while
    waiting for exclusivity is still not an option: it would trade a rare
    double-spend for a guaranteed hang, which is the freeze this function was
    rewritten to remove.

    The handle exists (rather than a plain ``bool``) because the ownership of
    the RELEASE has to be transferable: an exchange that outlives its connect
    keeps this lock until it has persisted its rotation
    (``_OAuthRefreshLock.transfer``), so neither a waiter's cancellation nor a
    budget overrun can free it while the POST is still on the wire — the window
    that let a sibling re-present the spent token and revoke the family.

    Two rules this function exists to enforce, both learned from a freeze that
    took the whole TUI down:

    1. **The acquire is bounded and non-blocking.** A bare
       ``fcntl.flock(fd, LOCK_EX)`` waits forever, so a lock leaked by a killed
       process parks a connect eternally.
    2. **The event loop never closes a descriptor a thread may be parked on.**
       The acquiring thread owns its fd end to end (:func:`_acquire_locked_fd`
       closes it itself on every non-success path), and the fd only ever
       reaches this coroutine once no lock syscall is outstanding on it. This
       matters because cancellation is routine here — ``/resume`` disposes the
       manager, which cancels in-flight connect tasks mid-acquire — and on
       macOS/BSD ``os.close()`` of a descriptor with a sibling thread inside
       ``flock()`` blocks until that ``flock()`` returns. Called from a
       ``finally`` on the event-loop thread, that stops the loop dead: the
       screen freezes and never repaints. Do not reintroduce a blocking acquire
       or an event-loop-side close of a possibly-in-use fd.

    * one whose task belongs to a CLOSED loop. It was abandoned by a loop that

      waiting for it pays the FULL bound and then logs a loss no exchange is
      carrying, on every later teardown in this process (reviewer round 1,

      can be recognised — its own done callback has not run and never will.
    * one whose task belongs to a DIFFERENT, still-open loop (the hand-driven
      loops in ``session/runtime``). It is not this loop's to drain and
      ``asyncio.wait`` cannot wait on a future from another loop, so it stays in
      the registry for whoever owns it.

    A DONE task is discarded here too. Normally the exchange's own done callback
    does that the tick after it resolves; when the loop closes first the callback
    never runs, and this is the same act arriving late. It is bookkeeping, not a
    loss: the exchange resolved, so whatever it was going to persist it has.

    The real overrun is deliberately NOT filtered out anywhere: a task that is
    live, not done and ours stays in the returned list, however long it takes.

    """Wait, BOUNDED, for detached refresh exchanges to persist their rotation.

    Called by the MCP teardown after it has cancelled every connect and while
    the credential store is still OPEN (see ``attach_auth_dispose``'s
    ``last=True`` and ``McpManager.disconnect_all``). Returns ``True`` when the
    registry emptied inside the bound and ``False`` when it did not — in which
    case the rotation of whatever was still running is lost, so the bound being
    hit is logged rather than tolerated silently.

    Three properties are deliberate:

    * **A cut, not a join.** The exchange's own budget is
      ``REFRESH_HTTP_TIMEOUT_S`` plus ``REFRESH_LATE_RESPONSE_GRACE_S`` and this
      process is on its way out, so the wait is capped at ``timeout_s`` (see
      ``REFRESH_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_S``). A wedged authorization server must cost a
      quit a couple of seconds, never a hang.
    * **The lock is not touched.** The exchange acquired and will release the
      cross-process refresh lock itself; waiting on the lock here would be
      waiting on the thing this function is waiting for.
    * **Nothing is cancelled.** A task that outlives the bound is left running:
      it may still land its rotation before the process really ends, and
      killing it here would be this module choosing to lose it.

    The loop re-reads the registry after each wait, because a cancellation
    delivered by the teardown itself can still be unwinding: a connect that has
    not yet reached its ``CancelledError`` arm has not registered its exchange
    yet, and a single snapshot taken before that would silently drain nothing.

    THE FIRST SNAPSHOT IS THEREFORE NEVER TAKEN BEFORE THIS COROUTINE HAS
    YIELDED. The re-read above only rescues the NON-EMPTY case, and the empty
    one is exactly the shape the caller creates: ``disconnect_all`` cancels the
    reconnects and reaches this function with no ``await`` between the cancels
    and the call whenever ``self._connections`` is empty, so a cancellation it
    has just delivered has not even been scheduled yet. Measured on this tree
    (reviewer R1-1 and QA Q5, independently): a cancel issued in the same
    synchronous stretch, then this call, returned ``True`` — read by every
    caller as "nothing in flight" — while a detached exchange registered one
    tick later, and closing the store on that verdict left the row holding the
    spent token with its marker armed, which is the incident this drain exists
    to remove. So the empty verdict is conclusive only after a yield, which the
    first pass below always gives it.

    Owns the whole exchange — the locked re-read, the request, the
    classification, the persistence AND the release of ``lock`` — so it can be
    detached from the connect that started it with no part of the result
    depending on a listener. Split out of :func:`_refresh_oauth_token_locked`
    for exactly that reason: the response is the only copy of a rotated refresh
    token, and every path that used to drop it (cancellation, the total timeout)
    did so by cancelling the request rather than by deciding against it.

    Holding the lock to the very END is what the reviewer's M2 was about. The
    caller-releases-it variant let a sibling in during the response read, where
    the store still holds the token this exchange has already spent — the
    reuse-detection POST that revokes the family.

    The request is also WRITE-AHEAD MARKED
    (:meth:`McpTokenStorage.mark_send_unconfirmed`) from an httpx REQUEST EVENT
    HOOK, i.e. at the point httpx is HANDED the request and starts sending it —
    still strictly before any answer can exist, because the hook runs before the
    transport — because the token is spent by the REQUEST and a process that dies
    mid-flight takes all in-memory knowledge with it. A failure BEFORE the
    request was written clears the marker again (the token was never presented,
    so that is an ordinary transient retry); anything later leaves it armed, and
    the refresh path then refuses to present that token until an interactive
    grant replaces it (see :data:`GRANT_UNCONFIRMED_SEND_KEY`).

    What that move IS and is NOT, stated at length because the first revision of
    this change claimed more than it delivers (reviewer round 1, R1-2, measured
    on httpx 0.28.1): the arm used to sit before ``httpx.AsyncClient`` was even
    constructed and now sits at the hook. That is SAFETY-NEUTRAL — the marker is
    never armed LATER than the request hook, so no request can go out unmarked — and
    it keeps the arm off the window before any request exists at all (a kill
    between the pre-flight reads and the client is no longer a quarantined
    grant). It does NOT narrow the CONNECT phase, and this docstring used to say
    it did: httpx runs request hooks in ``_send_handling_redirects``
    (``_client.py:1691``) and enters the transport — pool, DNS, TCP, TLS —
    afterwards in ``_send_single_request`` (``:1717``/``:1728``), so a
    cancellation during any of that still finds the marker armed, exactly as
    before. Nothing here removes that class: httpx offers no observable "the
    bytes are on the wire" seam short of socket-level surgery, and a hook that
    pretended otherwise would have to guess. The honest summary is that this
    change reports better and arms no earlier than it must — not that it spares
    the connect phase.

    ``send_state`` is the caller's record of that hand-off, used by the settle
    line on a detached exchange; a direct caller may leave it out. See
    :class:`RefreshSendState` for what it does and does not establish.

    ``lock=None`` means the CALLER owns exclusivity (the direct-call path used
    by the unit tests and by nothing else); a caller that hands over a handle it
    could not acquire gets a refusal instead of a POST.

    the stored token is simply left as-is, and the provider's non-interactive

    actionable :class:`McpAuthRequiredError` instead of a login tab. Lock
    ACQUISITION can still raise ``OSError`` (unwritable config dir, exhausted

    ``cfg`` is accepted for signature stability (the manager passes it, and a
    future per-server knob — e.g. opting out of proactive refresh — will need
    it) but is not consulted today.

    The refresh is wrapped in a cross-process lock with a re-read after

    """An ``OAuthClientProvider`` whose in-flow refresh is race-free across processes.

    Why this subclass exists: the SDK loads the stored tokens ONCE in
    ``_initialize`` and never re-reads storage afterwards, and its in-flow
    refresh (``async_auth_flow`` -> ``_refresh_token``) spends whatever refresh
    token that first read put in memory, under NO cross-process lock. That is
    fine for a token that expires and is refreshed once. It is destructive for a
    provider that ROTATES its refresh token on every use (Notion: an 8-hour
    access token plus a rotating refresh token) the moment more than one
    local-operator process is alive: this harness runs one process per cmux
    workspace, so several long-lived sessions cross the same 8-hour boundary
    still holding the same in-memory refresh token from when they booted. They
    each POST it; the authorization server rotates; the first wins and every
    other session's brand-new token is already dead. The SDK then
    ``clear_tokens()`` and the next request opens a FULL browser grant — the
    "Notion logged out again" the user sees, several times a day.

    :func:`ensure_mcp_oauth_fresh` already closes this race for the STARTUP
    refresh with a cross-process file lock and a re-read under it; its own
    docstring notes that the SDK's in-flow refresh is the remaining unlocked
    path. This subclass extends the same guard to that path: before the SDK
    would refresh, it re-reads the persisted token under
    :func:`_oauth_refresh_lock` and, if a sibling process already rotated it,
    ADOPTS the fresh token into the context and skips the refresh entirely.
    Only when the store still holds an expired token does exactly one process
    perform the exchange — against the discovered endpoint, so a provider whose
    token endpoint is not ``<server_base>/token`` (Datadog) refreshes rather
    than 404-ing into a browser grant.

    The invariant, enforced on EVERY path: the SDK's own (unlocked)
    ``_refresh_token`` must never run with an in-memory refresh token older than
    what storage holds. With no discovered ``endpoints`` (metadata discovery
    failed at startup) the coordinator no longer falls through to that unlocked
    refresh — it synthesizes the SDK's own fallback token endpoint
    (``<scheme>://<netloc>/token``) and performs the exchange UNDER THE LOCK
    with a fresh re-read, so even without discovery a stale boot-time refresh
    token is never presented a second time. Presenting one to a reuse-detecting
    provider (Notion) is what returns ``invalid_grant`` and revokes the whole
    token family. If the coordinated refresh itself raises, a final under-lock
    re-read still adopts the freshest persisted token before the SDK runs, so
    the invariant survives the exception fall-through too.

    The subclass additionally intercepts the FIRST 401 the resource server
    returns for the original request. The coordination step above only fires
    when the loaded token is EXPIRED, but a rotating provider (Notion) revokes
    every previously issued access token when a sibling refreshes — so a
    session can hold a locally-valid, server-side-revoked token that sails
    past coordination and gets a 401. Before that 401 reaches the SDK's full
    browser-authorization branch, the flow re-reads the store under the lock
    and, if a peer's different token is already there, adopts it and re-sends
    the request once. See ``async_auth_flow`` for the bound and the pass-through
    rule for genuinely dead grants.

            invalid-but-refreshable context means coordination did not produce
            a working token this time (the lock was unavailable, the exchange
            overran the connect's budget, the row held nothing it could present,
            the server answered without a usable token, or our own re-read/lock
            handling raised). The parameter DEFAULTS to the unattributed reason
            for the last of those: a caller that forgets to pass one gets the
            honest generic rather than the endpoint wording, which asserts
            something about a server it has not established.
            ``async_auth_flow`` returns straight into the SDK's own flow at that
            point, and the SDK's ``_refresh_token`` POSTs
            ``ctx.current_tokens.refresh_token`` DIRECTLY — no lock, no re-read —
            so the next thing on the wire would be a possibly already-rotated
            token, which a reuse-detecting provider answers with
            ``invalid_grant`` AND a family revocation.

            So strip it and raise a TRANSIENT error instead. Two properties are
            load-bearing:

            * the strip makes ``can_refresh_token()`` read False, so even if a
              caller swallows this error the SDK's refresh branch cannot run;
              and
            * the error is not an auth error, so it reaches the manager's
              generic reconnect arm — backoff and retry — rather than
              ``_block_on_auth``. Being unable to refresh is contention or a
              server fault, not a dead grant: blocking on auth here would
              strand a healthy server on a login prompt the user has no reason
              to run.

            ``outcome`` becomes the refusal REASON CODE, which is what lets the
            manager render a truthful short message per path: unable to take the
            lock, a budget overrun, an unreachable token endpoint and an answer
            without a usable token are four different things and were one
            sentence before (design review input; review round 2 minor 1 split
            the last of those off). The code is carried onto the ledger so the

            Returns the ORIGINAL request with its ``Authorization`` header
            rewritten when there is a working token to send, and ``None`` when
            the 401 must pass through to the SDK. Both arms run under ONE
            acquisition of the refresh lock, because both are decisions about a
            rotating grant and both must see a settled store:

            * **Adoption** (unchanged from the previous behaviour): the store
              holds an access token DIFFERENT from the one in memory, so a
              sibling rotated the grant; copy it and retry. Adoption spends
              nothing, so it can never double-spend, and the lock only
              serializes the re-read against a concurrent rotation.
            * **Refresh**: the store holds the SAME token (or none) and the grant
              is still refreshable. A 401 is then NOT evidence of a dead grant —
              it is evidence that nobody has rotated yet — so the refresh is
              performed HERE, under the lock, with the same re-read and endpoint
              discipline as the pre-request coordinator. Before this existed,
              this case fell straight through to the SDK, whose
              ``async_auth_flow`` POSTs ``current_tokens.refresh_token``
              directly: no lock, no re-read, and with the sibling's rotation
              already spent the request is a reuse-detection double-spend. It is
              also the one place a genuinely dead grant can be TOMBSTONED from a
              401 — :func:`_refresh_oauth_token_locked` writes the marker on a
              parsed ``invalid_grant``, which this path previously never
              reached, so every later boot re-POSTed the same rejected token.

            ``"dead"``, ``"failed"``, ``"contended"`` and ``"overran"`` all
            strip the in-memory refresh token and return ``None``: the SDK's own
            unlockable refresh cannot run either way, and the 401 reaches the
            SDK's authorization branch. They are deliberately NOT converted into
            a retryable error on this path — after a 401 the manager's
            ``_AuthChallengeWatcher`` has already latched, so a raise here is
            reclassified as McpAuthChallengeError and blocks on auth regardless.

            ``"unacknowledged"`` is the exception, and it is raised: the
            disposition is the same (auth is required), but the challenge text
            ("authorization expired") would be untrue for a refresh that was
            SENT and never confirmed, and that string is what the user reads.
            The raise carries the same ledger-backed re-voicing as the
            coordinator's refusal, so the manager renders the honest reason.

    """An ``OAuthClientProvider`` that knows when its stored token expires.

    The SDK reloads tokens on first use but NOT their deadline
    (``OAuthClientProvider._initialize`` sets ``current_tokens`` and leaves
    ``token_expiry_time`` at ``None``), and ``OAuthContext.is_token_valid``
    reads a missing deadline as "still good". So every fresh process presented
    a day-old access token, got a 401, and ran the FULL browser authorization
    — the refresh token sitting in the same row was never spent, because the
    refresh branch is only reached when the token is known to be expired.

    Priming the deadline from what we persisted is the whole fix: an expired
    token now takes the refresh grant, silently, with no browser. It is set
    after construction rather than passed in because the SDK offers no
    constructor argument for it, and ``_initialize`` does not clear it.

    ``interactive`` is forwarded to the flow (see :func:`wire_oauth_auth`).
    ``endpoints`` — the result of :func:`ensure_mcp_oauth_fresh` — primes the
    provider's authorization-server metadata, so a token that dies MID-session
    and needs an in-flow refresh targets the real token endpoint instead of the
    SDK's ``<server_base>/token`` guess (which 404s for providers like Datadog
    whose token endpoint lives on a different host).

    ``leaving`` is the teardown gate: a predicate the provider consults before
    it may start a refresh exchange, so a process on its way out never becomes
    the party that spends a rotating refresh token (see
    :meth:`_RefreshCoordinatingOAuthProvider._is_leaving`). It is optional
    because a provider built without an owner that can be torn down has nothing
    to gate on, and every existing caller therefore keeps today's behaviour.
