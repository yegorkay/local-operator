"""MCP connection manager: fast-startup gate, deferred tools, reconnect breaker.

Ports the established MCP manager semantics onto the official
``mcp`` Python SDK:

- A 250 ms startup gate (``asyncio.wait(timeout=0.25)``): servers that finish
  the gate contribute live tools; servers still pending WITH a tool-cache hit
  contribute deferred tools whose execute awaits the connection first;
  pending servers without a cache hit contribute nothing until a background
  continuation swaps them in via the ``on_tools_changed`` callback.
- Reconnect on transport close with backoff ``[0.5, 1, 2, 4]`` s and a
  circuit breaker: more than 5 attempts in a sliding 30 s window suspends
  auto-reconnect (manual reconnect resets the history). An epoch counter
  incremented on ``disconnect_all`` prevents a late reconnect from
  resurrecting a dead connection.
- Server-initiated ``notifications/tools/list_changed`` refreshes that
  server's tools and fires the tools-changed callback.

SDK imports are lazy where feasible so config-only callers never pay for the
transport machinery.

NOTE (session integration): this module deliberately does NOT wire itself
into the harness session loop — the ExecCli stream owns that integration
(``discover_and_load_mcp_tools`` + ``set_on_tools_changed`` rebinding). This
package exports only the manager surface; consumers must drive lifecycle.

#: Deliberately says only what is true of every refusal in the set — never
#: ``str(exc)``, whose URL prefix would render as the fragment this whole mapping
#: exists to remove. Defined ABOVE the table so the table can reference it rather
#: than repeat the sentence.
REFRESH_REFUSAL_UNKNOWN_TEXT = "the refresh did not complete"

#: Short, user-visible text per TRANSIENT refresh refusal, keyed by the stable
#: reason code the auth layer carries on the exception
#: (:data:`~local_operator.mcp.auth.REFRESH_REFUSAL_LOCK` and friends). Composed
#: HERE rather than in ``auth.py`` because the code, not the sentence, is what
#: travels: the auth layer's own ``str(exc)`` opens with
#: ``MCP OAuth token refresh for https://<host>/<path>`` and is ~55 cells before
#: it says anything distinguishing, so it cannot be the rendered copy.
#:
#: Every entry is measured against the two surfaces that clamp it — the startup
#: toast, whose detail line is ``failed: <name> — <this>`` truncated to 58 cells
#: at 100 columns and 36 at 44 (so <this> gets 41 and 19 respectively) — and the
#: durable notice, which is the full terminal width. The rules the wording obeys:
#:
#: * NO full URL and no subsystem internals (no "refresh lock", no "rotation"):
#:   the host line already names the server, and a user cannot act on our nouns;
#: * the DISTINGUISHING word comes first, because the toast tail-truncates: every
#:   entry must differ within its first ~19 cells or the 44-column card renders
#:   the same fragment for all of them (design review D1);
#: * the condition, not a promise: the two in-flight refusals read as states that
#:   may clear on their own (another session is on it; the exchange is still
#:   running), the other two name the server side as the problem, which is the
#:   only "does this heal by itself?" signal a user can get;
#: * NEVER blame a server for a request that did not go out. The two LOCAL
#:   shapes — nothing in the row the exchange could present, and a failure of
#:   our own coordination — get their own wording, because the endpoint code's
#:   "the server returned no token" is false about the wire AND about the
#:   server for both (review round 3, M2);
#: * NO command and NO "retrying": for a transient refusal the remedy
#:   mid-session is the manager's own backoff reconnect, while the startup gate
#:   schedules nothing at all — so offering a command would send the user at a
#:   destructive ``reauth`` for a self-healing condition, and promising a retry
#:   would be untrue at boot. Only the auth requirement
#:   (``McpRefreshUnconfirmedError``) leads with a command, and it is rendered by
#:   ``_auth_required_text``, not from this table.
#:
#: ``REFRESH_REFUSAL_UNATTRIBUTED`` shares :data:`REFRESH_REFUSAL_UNKNOWN_TEXT`
#: rather than minting a near-synonym: both mean "we cannot name a cause", and
#: two sentences for one honest statement would only invite them to drift.

# remote server at once, and it is the only cause the user can act on at the
# moment they read it (tether, wait, change network). Reported as the SDK's own
# sentence (``Request 'initialize' timed out``) it read as an MCP fault: on the
# captured boot that produced this change, 10 of 11 servers "failed" with that
# line and nothing on screen said the machine's connection was the problem, so
# the fault was chased through MCP config and OAuth state instead. This copy is

#: carries the resolver's own sentence in the ConnectError message — measured:

#: ``REQUEST_TIMEOUT`` (``mcp.shared.jsonrpc_dispatcher``, where the pair is
#: documented as the client's own contract). Written as literals rather than
#: imported because those names are SDK internals — a rename there must not
#: turn this classifier into a silent no-op, so
#: ``test_mcp_transport_failure.py`` pins both numbers against the installed
#: SDK and fails if they move.
_TRANSPORT_RPC_DETAIL: dict[int, str] = {-32000: "closed", -32001: "timeout"}

#: The dispatcher's OWN wording for those codes, as (prefix, suffix) bounds:

#: and ``REQUEST_TIMEOUT`` interpolates the method name the caller asked for
#: (``Request 'initialize' timed out``). Matched as bounds rather than by
#: equality because the method is the caller's, not ours.
#:
#: WHY the code alone is not enough: both numbers sit in JSON-RPC's
#: implementation-defined SERVER range, and the SDK raises the SAME
#: ``MCPError`` class for a peer's own error response
#: (``mcp/shared/jsonrpc_dispatcher.py`` re-raises ``ErrorData`` verbatim). A
#: server answering ``-32000`` with "Internal error" therefore used to render
#: as "the connection to <host> closed" AND be counted against the user's
#: network — the mirror of the defect this change fixes, with several such
#: servers making the toast claim ``failed (network)`` over a perfectly good
#: link (agent review R1-1). Reading the pair together keeps the code match for
#: the client's own contract and refuses the peer's reuse of the number.

    rule lives: two copies of a rule that decides whether to spend a rotating
    refresh token is how one of them ends up able to storm.

    Two axes, and either one moving is evidence:

    * the STAMP — the row's chain stamp, which moves when a grant is actually
      replaced (a peer's ``/mcp reauth``, a login, a logout) — together with the
      row's TOMBSTONE, which the pre-witness rule (``marker == known``) compared
      as part of the same tuple and which is kept here for that reason: a peer
      tombstoning the grant we blocked on is news about it, and the one attempt
      it buys is bounded by the marker moving again. (Inert today, because the
      store strips ``grant_dead_at`` on write — the deferred tombstone finding —
      but the rule must not lose the axis the strip's fix will need.)
    * the WITNESS — ``grant_ok.at``, which moves when some process's connect
      STOOD UP on this chain. It is the only axis that can see a sibling's heal
      on the SAME chain, which a chain rule cannot: a sibling's rotation carries
      the stamp forward, so a session blocked during a temporary provider
      rejection would otherwise wait for a new grant that nobody is going to
      obtain.

    ``known.witness_at is None`` means this session has never consumed a witness,
    so ANY witness is news for it; otherwise the comparison is strictly NEWER,
    which is what makes an already-consumed value buy nothing. That strictness is
    the whole bound: a witness value exists only because a connect succeeded, and
    a success clears its own session's block, so retries are bounded by events
    rather than by ticks (measured: 6 witness values → 6 retries over 60 polls,
    never 60).

    An unreadable store never reaches here: both callers screen ``None`` out
    before this rule, because ``None`` is no information at all rather than a
    value that differs from whatever we hold.

    Created by the caller that can block on auth, filled by ``_connect_server``
    as its first act, and consumed by the single arm that blocks. Ownership is
    the fix, not a tidiness: the per-server dict this replaced could outlive the
    attempt it described, because ``_connect_server`` runs for callers that
    never block (``connect_configured_server``, and every non-auth failure), so a
    LATER auth failure that died before the seam popped a marker from an
    unrelated, older attempt and blocked against it (agent review round 2,
    major-2). A local record cannot do that by construction: nothing is keyed by
    server name, an unconsumed record is collected with the attempt's frame, and
    a caller that passes nothing records nothing.

    ``marker`` starts as "not recorded" rather than ``None`` so that a connect
    failing BEFORE it could read the store stays distinguishable from one that
    read the store and found it unreadable — see :data:`_MARKER_NOT_RECORDED`.

    The marker's third element (:class:`~local_operator.mcp.auth.GrantMarker`'s
    ``witness_at``) is the SUCCESS-WITNESS BASELINE, and it rides in the same
    value on purpose rather than in a field of its own: the baseline IS "the
    witness value this attempt read", which is exactly what the seam's single
    ``_grant_marker`` fetch already returns, so a second slot would be a second
    copy of one fact — the class of duplicated state this module keeps paying
    for. What matters is that it is taken BY THE ATTEMPT (at the seam, before the
    transport opens) and not at block time: a witness written during our failing
    attempt is one this session has NOT consumed, so a baseline read afterwards
    would swallow it and the block would never lift (the same defect class as the
    round-2 major-2 marker, on the witness axis).

# 300 s, DERIVED rather than guessed, and the derivation is the point: an earlier
# revision of this constant said 60 s on the belief that it matched the sibling
# CLI harness, which was true of codex only up to about v0.100. The sibling
# actually installed here reports ``codex-cli 0.147.0``, and its own source at
# that tag (``codex-rs/codex-mcp/src/rmcp_client.rs``, ``rust-v0.147.0``) reads:
#
#     pub(crate) const DEFAULT_STARTUP_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(30);
#     pub(crate) const DEFAULT_TOOL_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(300);
#
# So the number a caller must express parity with is 300, and a version-chasing
# constant is the wrong shape for this: it silently rots the moment upstream
# moves, and it rots in the direction that looks like a deliberate policy.
#
# THAT IS WHY THE BUDGETS THAT MATTER ARE NOW DECLARED, NOT INHERITED. A caller
# that cares (Minerva's risk-assessment tool server does) states the budget in
# the shared per-run MCP document, and both harnesses bind to that declared
# value — so no workload's behaviour depends on either client's default. This
# constant is only the floor under a server nobody declared, and it is set to
# the sibling's own figure so an undeclared server behaves the same on both.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY: this is 5x the 60 s this constant briefly held,
# and 10x the 30 s that is STILL SHIPPED in the packaged harness today — the
# release that carries this change is what actually moves a lop run off 30 s, so
# quoting one factor without saying which baseline it is against is how a
# document ends up disagreeing with itself.
# The timer's job is to bound a WEDGED server, not a slow-but-working one; a
# stdio child that has died is caught by the stream-pump failure path rather
# than by this timer, and 300 s still bounds a hang. A caller who wants a tighter
# bound for its own servers has two levers that take precedence — the
# ``LOCAL_OPERATOR_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS`` env override and a per-server ``timeout`` —
# and a deployment that declares budgets in its config never reaches this value
# at all.

    Raised where the connect path would otherwise have to hand its caller an

    reasons that are the same reason:

    * **It settles.** A transport failure inside the streamable-HTTP transport
      reaches ``_connect_server`` as a bare ``CancelledError`` — anyio cancels
      the awaiting task when a task-group sibling dies, and the transport's own
      reader or writer dying is exactly what a refused connection, a DNS
      failure and a TLS error look like from there. That cancellation is
      indistinguishable, at that point, from the one a dispose or reload
      performs, so it was re-raised unchanged and read as a TEARDOWN by
      ``_finish_pending``, which drops those on purpose. The server then stayed
      in ``_startup_deferred`` for the life of the process: ``startup_settling``
      never went False, the outcome was never reportable, and because a settling
      outcome is deliberately silent, the ONE fault class that takes out several
      servers at once — the network — was the one that reported nothing at all.
      Measured on the reproduction in ``test_mcp_transport_failure.py``: two
      unreachable servers, 0 failures reported, and ``settling`` still True
      after 15 s of polling.
    * **It is labelled.** ``url`` and ``detail`` are what
      :func:`_transport_failure_text` turns into a line that names the network
      instead of quoting the SDK, so a fleet-wide outage reads as one
      connectivity problem rather than as nine unrelated MCP faults.

    Deliberately a SUBCLASS of :class:`McpConnectionError`, because a transport
    failure IS a connection failure and callers that reason about
    "connected or not" should not have to learn a second type. It is not
    caught by name anywhere under ``local_operator/``: the deferred execute
    path catches ``Exception`` (and re-reads the rendered text through the

    ``/login <provider>`` and ``credential update <PROVIDER_API_KEY>``, which

    has nothing to do with the Anthropic key. Sending a user to re-authorize a

    ``remedy`` is the SERVER-SPECIFIC advice, and this function deliberately

    package emits (``MCP server 'linear' …``), so they are tried first and a
    bare substring is the fallback for the URL-shaped messages.

    The loose pass is ANCHORED ON WORD BOUNDARIES, which is not cosmetic: an
    unanchored substring matched inside a URL path, so a server named ``git``
    was named out of ``https://example.com/git-things`` and reported as the
    unambiguous answer (review R6). Short generic names — ``git``, ``api``,

#: MEASURED 2026-08-11 against ``workspace-mcp`` 1.23.1 — the server the defect
#: was reported on — with its stderr on a real PTY:
#:
#: ===============================  ==========  =======
#: child stderr                     bytes       artwork
#: ===============================  ==========  =======
#: PTY, ``TERM=xterm-256color``     3289        yes
#: PTY, all of ``CHILD_QUIET_ENV``  2391        yes
#: PIPE                            **303**      **no**
#: ===============================  ==========  =======
#:
#: So these variables do NOT stop this server drawing its logo: it decides on
#: ``isatty()``, and only redirecting the stream (see ``_stdio_transport``)
#: actually silences it. What they buy is the ~900 bytes of colour escapes
#: between rows one and two, which would otherwise be written into the log
#: file and corrupt ``less``/``tail`` there instead of on the frame.
#:
#: Kept for that, and because the next third-party server will differ — one
#: that renders unconditionally is exactly the case the stream redirect
#: handles and the environment does not, and vice versa.
#:
#: EVERY ENTRY HERE TURNS COLOUR OFF BY ITS OWN CONVENTION, and that is a
#: harder rule than it looks. ``FORCE_COLOR`` and ``CLICOLOR_FORCE`` were in
#: this dict set to ``"0"``, which reads like an opt-out and is not one:
#: force-color.org senses PRESENCE, so Rich takes ``FORCE_COLOR=0`` as "yes, I
#: am a terminal" (``rich/console.py``: ``if force_color is not None: return
#: force_color != ""``). MEASURED on a pipe — where the child had already
#: given up on colour — adding ``FORCE_COLOR=0`` to the rest of this dict
#: turned ``b'LOGO\n'`` back into ``b'\x1b[1mLOGO\x1b[0m\n'`` for a server
#: whose config restores ``TERM``; ``test_the_quiet_env_actually_silences_rich``
#: keeps that measurement running. ``CLICOLOR_FORCE=0`` is inert in Rich by the
#: same measurement and by bixense's spec (force only when non-zero), but it is
#: presence-sensed elsewhere and buys nothing here, so it goes with it.
#: Both are gone, and leaving them UNSET is the whole of the fix: this dict is
#: not merged into the operator's own environment but into
#: ``get_default_environment()``, which copies an allowlist
#: (``DEFAULT_INHERITED_ENV_VARS``: ``HOME``, ``LOGNAME``, ``PATH``, ``SHELL``,
#: ``TERM``, ``USER``) and nothing else, so a ``FORCE_COLOR`` in the shell that
#: launched us cannot reach a server either. What is left here is only opt-OUT
#: switches: ``NO_COLOR`` (https://no-color.org, presence disables),
#: ``TERM=dumb``, ``CLICOLOR=0`` (bixense.com/clicolors), and ``PY_COLORS=0``.
#: Before adding another, check that its documented sense is "off" and not
#: "force" — and that its off value is a VALUE and not an absence.
#:
#: A server that wants any of them back sets it in its config ``env``, which is
#: merged last and wins.
CHILD_QUIET_ENV: dict[str, str] = {

}

#: How long teardown waits for the stderr pump after the child has exited. The
#: pipe is normally at EOF already and this returns instantly; the bound only
#: bites when a surviving descendant still holds the write end, and there is
#: nothing more of the SERVER's own output to wait for in that case. Kept
#: short even though ``disconnect_all`` now closes connections concurrently:
#: any single stdio server still pays it inline on ``/mcp reconnect`` and
#: ``disconnect_server``, where nothing overlaps it.
STDERR_DRAIN_GRACE_S = 0.25

#: Grace a stdio server gets at each rung of teardown (stdin EOF, then
#: SIGTERM, then SIGKILL) before escalation to the next rung. The wait is
#: event-driven — ``process.wait()`` wakes the moment the child exits — so a
#: prompt server pays nothing and only a stubborn one sits out a rung. The
#: value preserves the budget of the 0.1 s polling loop it replaced (20 ticks
#: per rung); what changed is the wake latency, not the patience.
STDIO_EXIT_GRACE_S = 2.0

#: Bound on closing ONE connection's exit stack (see
#: :meth:`McpManager._teardown_connection`). Bounded at all because a remote
#: transport's close is network I/O — the streamable-HTTP transport DELETEs
#: its session on an HTTP client whose connect timeout alone is 30 s — and a
#: dead network must not be able to hold quit hostage for that long. Five
#: seconds matches the session's other dispose bounds (turn abort, browser
#: close, title flush): comfortably above any healthy close, and a pause a
#: person will sit through once rather than a hang they will kill -9.
CONNECTION_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT_S = 5.0

#: Stderr lines retained per stdio server for the failure report. A Python
#: traceback plus the banner that preceded it fits inside this; a chatty server
#: cannot pin more than this many lines of memory per connection.
STDERR_TAIL_LINES = 50

#: Longest stderr line kept whole. A server that writes without ever emitting a
#: newline must not turn into an unbounded log record.
STDERR_LINE_LIMIT = 2_000

#: How many trailing stderr lines are quoted into a failed connect's error
#: text, and how many characters of them. That message is rendered whole by the
#: transcript notice and by ``/mcp`` — only the toast truncates — so a server
#: whose last words are a 2000-character line must not become a wall of text
#: where a reason belongs. The full tail is in the log.

class _AuthChallengeWatcher:
    """Records whether an HTTP MCP server answered 401/403 on this attempt.

    Installed as an httpx ``response`` event hook on the transport's client.
    It exists because the status code is destroyed downstream: the SDK turns a
    401 it cannot resolve into ``MCPError(-32603, 'Server returned an error
    response')`` — no status, no headers — which is the opaque text the user
    reported. Observing at the transport keeps the one fact the message needs.

    The hook is deliberately passive: it never raises and never reads the body
    (the body is a lazily-streamed SSE payload, and touching it here would
    consume the stream the SDK is about to parse). The connect's error path
    decides what to do with the observation.

    Three properties are load-bearing, and all three are regression-tested:

    - **The endpoint is matched semantically, not by string equality.** A
      server may canonicalize ``/mcp`` to ``/mcp/`` with a 307 and only then
      challenge; the SDK's client follows redirects, so the final response's
      request URL is not the configured string. Comparing raw text there
      dropped exactly the challenge the user needed to see (F1).
    - **The verdict belongs to the LAST request, not the last response.** The
      status is cleared when a new request to the endpoint *starts*, and set
      again only if that request comes back 401/403. Clearing on the response
      alone was not enough: a retry that dies at DNS/connect/TLS/read time
      produces no response at all, so the previous challenge stayed latched and
      a terminal NETWORK failure was reported as "run /mcp login" (F5, and the
      case F2's response-only fix missed). Binding to the request means an
      unanswered request leaves no verdict behind, which is the honest state.
    - **A redirect hop is not a verdict.** It is the client being sent
      elsewhere, and the request it triggers carries the challenge that
      matters.

    :attr:`saw_challenge` is the one piece of state that does NOT follow the
    last-request rule, and the reason it exists is the concession that rule
    costs. Clearing on ``begin`` is what keeps a dead retry honest, but it also
    throws away a challenge the peer really did answer: an SDK whose initialize
    POST gets a 401 and then gives up on a retry that never produces a response
    leaves the connect with NO verdict, and a reachable-but-refusing server gets
    reported as a network failure — the user is sent to diagnose a link that
    works instead of running ``/mcp login|reauth`` (QA round 1, Q1-1). So the
    observation is recorded a second time in a slot ``begin`` does not clear, and
    only the transport-failure path reads it (``_challenge_error``'s
    ``prefer_observed``): for every other shape the last-request verdict is the
    right one and F5 stands.

    The concession is bounded by the peer's own answer, and that bound is
    load-bearing: the latch is cleared by ANY endpoint response that is not a
    challenge — whatever its status, and 3xx excepted because a redirect hop is
    the client being sent elsewhere rather than a verdict (the early return in
    :meth:`observe`). That is wider than "the attempt was authorised", and
    deliberately so: the clear is a DISPROOF, not a verdict. It answers one
    question — did the peer speak on this endpoint during this attempt? — and a
    4xx/5xx answers it exactly as well as a 200, because the failure mode this
    guards is a later transport death being read as the peer never having
    spoken. The case that made the clear necessary is a 401 the attempt then
    SATISFIED — challenge, 200, and only then a transport death — where the
    latched verdict reported a proven-good grant as "run /mcp login" and, worse,
    wrote the durable OAuth-challenge record ``_challenge_error`` re-verdicts the
    next connect with (review round 2, R2-1).

    Narrowing the clear to 2xx was considered and rejected (review round 3,
    R3-1): it would re-arm the latch on the strength of a response the peer did
    NOT confirm as satisfied, and that sequence is not reachable anyway — the
    streamable-HTTP client opens its GET stream only on the ``initialized``
    notification and sends DELETE only once a session id exists, so neither can
    precede a challenge, and a peer 4xx/5xx surfaces as its own server error
    rather than as a transport death. This paragraph, like the class, follows the
    code: a future editor who wants the narrow form has to bring the evidence
    that it is reachable. So the latch survives exactly the one thing it exists
    for: a request that never got an answer at all.

        This is the seam tests override: it returns a :class:`ServerConnection`
        without touching a real server.

        ``interactive`` controls OAuth: an ordinary startup or auto-reconnect
        passes ``False`` and must never open a browser — an unrefreshable grant
        surfaces as an actionable :class:`McpAuthRequiredError` instead. Only
        an explicit ``/mcp login`` (``connect_configured_server``) runs with
        ``True``.

        Before opening the transport, an OAuth server gets a PROACTIVE refresh
        (:func:`~local_operator.mcp.auth.ensure_mcp_oauth_fresh`): it spends a
        stored refresh token against the DISCOVERED token endpoint, race-free
        across concurrently starting sessions, so a day-old access token never
        forces a browser grant on startup.

        ``env`` and ``headers`` arrive as ``${NAME}`` secret references and are
        resolved to their values first (see :mod:`local_operator.mcp.secret_refs`),
        so the child process and the HTTP client are never handed the reference
        text. The resolution is per connect ATTEMPT on purpose — a credential
        added while the session is running is picked up by a reconnect — and the
        reference form is what both ``self._configs`` (which ``config_digest``
        hashes for the tool cache) and the live :class:`ServerConnection` keep, so
        no resolved value outlives the transport that needed it.

        ``attempt`` is the CALLER's record of the grant this attempt starts
        with, filled here and read by that caller if the connect fails on auth.
        Only callers that can block on auth pass one (see :class:`_AttemptRecord`)

        Leads with the COMMAND that fixes it rather than the diagnosis. The
        toast renders this after a ``failed: <name> — `` prefix and then clamps
        to the card width, so the tail is what gets truncated: putting the
        command first keeps the one actionable thing on screen even on a narrow
        terminal, where ``needs authorization — /mcp login <name>`` used to
        sever the command mid-word (design review D1). One ``—`` only, so the
        composed line is not a chain of dashes (D4). The same string lands in
        the durable transcript notice and in ``/mcp``, so one helper keeps all
        three surfaces agreeing.

        The command is BARE (``/mcp reauth <name>``, not ``run /mcp reauth
        <name>``), and that is a measurement rather than a style choice (design
        review D9): the ``run `` wrapper spends four cells, which is exactly the
        shortfall that pushed the reason past the toast card's clamp at 100
        columns and cut the server name mid-word at 44. The bare form is also
        the app's own habit for a runnable command (``/       command picker``
        on the splash, ``sign-in expired — /login kimi`` in the usage panel),
        and the name argument has to stay: ``/mcp reauth`` with no name is
        ``usage: /mcp reauth <name>``, an instruction that errors when followed.

        ``login`` vs ``reauth`` is decided by whether a stored grant exists,
        not guessed. Reaching this error at all means the stored grant could
        not be refreshed non-interactively, so a server we DO hold one for is
        holding a stale one: telling that user to ``login`` points them at a
        command that leaves the dead credential in place, while ``reauth``
        replaces it. A server with nothing stored has never been authorized.

        A challenge carries that fact on itself, already resolved against the
        manager's OWN (possibly injected) store at the instant the failure was
        classified — so it is used as-is. Re-reading the default machine store
        here would answer a different question than the one that produced the
        error, and a session running against an injected store rendered
        ``login`` for a server it demonstrably held a grant for (F4). Only the
        legacy :class:`McpAuthRequiredError`, which carries no such field,

        stored for it, and whether the server can take an OAuth grant at all.
        A free function can see the rendered string and nothing else, so an
        earlier revision guessed ``/mcp reauth`` for every shape and was wrong
        for two of the three real ones (review R5): a never-logged-in server

        endpoint — Datadog does — cannot be fixed by any grant command and needs

        route to a usable server passes through — ``/mcp login``,

        The identity of the grant this session gave up on. Three properties make
        it safe to retry against:

        * the float is the CHAIN STAMP, not the row's raw
          ``tokens_obtained_at`` — it is ``GRANT_CHAIN_KEY``'s ``issued_at`` with
          that key's F rule (see ``local_operator.mcp.auth``), and the CALLER
          does not re-derive it here. That distinction is load-bearing rather
          than stylistic: ``tokens_obtained_at`` is moved by BOTH funnels that
          can produce a grant — an interactive login AND our own refresh
          rotation — so a marker keyed on it goes stale the instant a connect we
          performed ourselves fails, and every later tick reads our own write as
          a peer's re-auth: one connect and one refresh POST per tick, per
          process, against a provider running reuse detection. That is the storm
          ``GRANT_DEAD_AT_KEY`` was built to stop.
        * ``grant_is_dead`` catches the reverse transition — a peer tombstoning
          a grant we still believe in. We want to observe it (it changes the
          marker, so the block is re-taken against current truth); the single
          attempt that follows is bounded by the marker moving again.
        * ``witness_at`` catches the transition NEITHER of the other two can see:
          a sibling connected successfully on the same chain, which moves no
          stamp because its rotation carries the chain (:data:`GRANT_OK_KEY`).
          It is the one POSITIVE fact in the marker, and it is why a session
          blocked over a temporary provider rejection still heals.

        Returns ``None`` — never a sentinel TUPLE — when the store cannot be
        read, and never raises: auth state is best-effort throughout this
        subsystem, and a poller that raises into a dispose hook is worse than
        one that declines to heal.

        The ``None`` matters as much as the value. A degraded read that returned
        ``(0.0, False)`` would be a marker like any other, so a store failing on
        alternating ticks would make the marker appear to oscillate
        ``real -> (0.0, False) -> real`` and every tick would count as "a peer
        re-authed" and spend a refresh token. That is §7 risk 1 — the
        family-revoking storm — reached through the degrade path instead of
        through a naive ``updated_at``. Unknown must be un-comparable, not a
        value: :meth:`revalidate_auth_blocked` treats it as "stay blocked,
        unchanged", and :meth:`_block_on_auth` refuses to overwrite a good
        marker with it.

        Called from every arm that gives up over authorization. Recording the
        marker AT BLOCK TIME is what lets ``revalidate_auth_blocked`` tell "the
        grant we already failed on" from "a grant somebody has since replaced".

        ``attempted`` is the marker the FAILED ATTEMPT started with — in
        practice ``_AttemptRecord.marker``, filled by ``_connect_server`` as its
        first act — and passing it is what keeps the block FALSIFIABLE. Reading
        the marker here instead — after the failure — records whatever is on
        disk *now*, which is not necessarily what the attempt used: an OAuth
        connect takes seconds (PRM/ASM discovery plus a token exchange), and a
        peer's ``/mcp reauth`` landing inside that window is written before this
        line runs. The block was then taken against the NEW grant, and since a
        working grant is never re-obtained its marker never moves again — so
        ``revalidate_auth_blocked`` could never lift it and the server stayed
        dead for the life of the process against a perfectly good credential.

        That is not an exotic race. The window is exactly one connect wide, and
        the human re-authing inside it is doing so BECAUSE this server just told
        them it needed authorizing, so the two are causally linked rather than
        merely concurrent. Observed on an operator's machine 2026-09-18: a
        ``linear`` connect failed at 22:13:18 having used a grant from before
        22:11:06, blocked on the 22:11:06 row, and was still dead ten hours
        later while sibling sessions used that same row without trouble.

        The SAME argument is why the marker's third element — the success-witness
        baseline — is recorded from the attempt rather than read here. The retry
        rule compares a freshly read witness against the one the attempt
        CONSUMED, so a baseline taken at block time would silently swallow a
        sibling's success that landed during our own failing attempt: that success
        is newer than the attempt's own read, which is exactly what makes it the
        NEXT tick's evidence rather than this block's baseline. Recording it here
        instead would make the Q1 heal arrive never rather than one poll later
        (same defect class as the round-2 major-2 marker, on the witness axis).

        Callers that cannot say what they tried omit it entirely (the
        :data:`_MARKER_NOT_RECORDED` default) and keep the old read-here
        behaviour, which is still correct whenever no grant was written during
        the attempt. That is a DIFFERENT fact from ``attempted=None``, which
        says the attempt looked and the store was unreadable: sharing one value
        for both made the unreadable case fall back to a post-failure read and
        so reintroduced the unfalsifiable block for exactly that case (review
        round 1, minor-1).

        An unreadable store (``None``) must not clobber a marker we already
        hold: overwriting a known grant with "unknown" would make the NEXT
        successful read compare unequal and buy a retry the grant never earned.
        Keeping the old value means a transient failure costs nothing, and a
        first block that cannot read the store simply stays unknown until one
        can.

        The sentinel is a real TYPE (:class:`_NotRecorded`), not ``Any``, so a
        call site that hands over the wide ``marker`` value without resolving it
        fails type-check rather than silently blocking against the sentinel —
        which is how ``self._auth_grant_marker[name]`` below was found storing
        the unresolved union. Resolution is by ``isinstance`` rather than by
        ``is``: the sentinel is one INSTANCE, but the type system cannot prove
        it is the only one, so ``is`` narrows nothing and any future value of
        the type would slip past.

          calls — see :data:`AUTH_REVALIDATE_INTERVAL_S`).
        * **One attempt per genuine grant change.** A server whose marker moved
          but still fails re-blocks on the NEW marker, so a broken grant costs
          one connect per change rather than one per tick — and an UNREADABLE
          marker buys nothing at all, because unknown is not movement. The same
          bound covers the second axis, the SUCCESS WITNESS: a witness value is
          created only by a connect that stood up, and a successful connect clears
          its own session's block, so a value that has already been consumed buys
          nothing (see :func:`_grant_change_is_evidence`).
        * **Never interactive.** ``_connect_server`` is called with the default
          ``interactive=False``: this path runs unattended in nine processes,
          and opening a browser from it would be a fleet of surprise auth
          windows. A grant that needs a human still surfaces as
