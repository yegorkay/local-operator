"""The attach client: a follower terminal's half of the control socket.

Every interactive ``lop`` process hosts a session runtime
(:class:`~local_operator.session.runtime.server.RuntimeServer`)
whose loopback socket is the phone's window onto the session. This module is
the SAME socket seen from a second terminal: ``/resume`` of a session another
process owns dials that owner and renders its projection repaints, steering
through the same ops the phone uses. One socket, N front ends — a second
protocol would drift from the first, so there is none.

Design constraints baked in:

- **No auto-reconnect.** Owner death (socket EOF) is terminal for the
  CONNECTION — never papered over by redialing a pid that may have been
  reused. The callback fires once and the client is dead. What the HOST does
  next changed in v4: ``AttachedSession`` runs a silent reattach-or-takeover
  loop (re-discover the owner, or become it through the normal resume
  factory) instead of showing a decision card, but each loop iteration still
  builds a FRESH client against a freshly discovered record.
- **Identity over pid trust.** ``live_runtime_pid`` cannot probe pids on
  Windows, and a recycled pid anywhere defeats pid trust. After auth the
  registrant sends a full projection unprompted; the client requires that
  projection's ``session_id`` to match the one the user asked for before
  declaring the attach good. A mismatch means the owner rebound away — the
  caller surfaces the graceful refusal copy.
- **Protocol gate before dialing.** A v1 registrant treats ANY authenticated
  dial as THE daemon and evicts the real one; requiring ``record.protocol
  >= 2`` turns that hazard into the graceful degradation path instead.

Stdlib-only plus the mobile wire types: the CLI imports this lazily on the
owned-resume branch only, keeping ``resume.py`` and the startup path light.

#: How long to wait for an ack/error matching a request id. Mirrors the
#: daemon's ``request`` timeout: long enough for a turn-boundary op (prompt
#: acquires the turn lock) on a busy owner, short enough that a wedged owner
#: surfaces as an error rather than a hang.
ACK_TIMEOUT_S = 15.0

#: The whole viewer-side budget for one §6 redaction forward (viewer → owner,
#: ``register_secret_redaction``). Sized well under the broker's
#: ``NOTIFY_ACK_TIMEOUT_S`` (2 s) on purpose: the broker denies the child when
#: the session does not acknowledge in time, so a hop that stalls must give up
#: and fail closed BEFORE that deadline rather than eating it and turning the
#: denial into an ambiguous timeout. The TUI's notice thread bounds its wait on
#: this same constant, so both sides of the hop share one budget.
REDACTION_FORWARD_TIMEOUT_S = 1.0

#: How long to wait for ``complete_aside`` — a full provider round trip, not a
#: control-plane op. Matched to ``providers/clients.py`` ``STREAM_READ_TIMEOUT_S
#: = 180.0``, the layer below's own budget for silence from a stream in flight:
#: shorter and this client kills requests that layer still considers healthy;
#: much longer and a genuinely wedged owner stops surfacing at all. Raising it
#: does NOT lengthen the owner's head-of-line block: the owner stays parked on
#: the whole provider call either way, so today's 15 s buys no unblocking and
#: only guarantees a false error while the block continues. See
#: docs/design-aside-deadline.md §3, and §1.1 for that socket defect — still
#: present, deliberately not fixed here.
ASIDE_DEADLINE_S = 180.0

#: Disconnect reason marking a DELIBERATE stop, as opposed to owner death.
#: Consumers compare against this exact string to decide whether to recover.
STOPPED_REASON = "owner stopped the session"

#: Disconnect reason for a PLANNED refresh: the owner retired itself because
#: ``lop-update`` put a newer build on disk, and the next engage should spawn
#: from it. Distinct from :data:`STOPPED_REASON` on purpose — a stop parks the
#: viewer in the stopped state (``/resume`` reopens it); a refresh means "a
#: fresh runtime is owed, engage one now". Nothing was interrupted: the owner
#: retires only when idle (``ServingSessionHandle.may_refresh``).
RETIRING_REASON = "owner retired for a newer build"

#: Disconnect reason for a connection the owner could not BIND — its canonical
#: ``frontend_sync`` never arrived and the runtime closed this one connection.
#:
#: The third member of the reason class above, and the one whose absence was a
#: lie: with no frame carrying it, the closed socket fell through to
#: :data:`_pump`'s default (``"owner exited"``), so a viewer told the person
#: their SESSION had died when the truth was that the process was alive, the
#: session untouched, and one connection unbound. The frame that carries it
#: (``bind_failed``) is additive — an older client ignores an unknown op and
#: reports exactly what it reported before.
#:
#: THE SENTENCE CARRIES THE TWO THINGS THE OTHER REASONS LEAVE IMPLICIT, and it
#: has to, because this one is the only reason whose truth is the OPPOSITE of
#: what the neighbouring string says: ``"owner exited"`` is the default this
#: replaces, so a reader who has learned that class of sentence will assume the
#: session is gone unless told otherwise. Hence the liveness clause, and hence a
#: remedy in the shape this module's refusal copy uses (``"owner returned no
#: fork; retry /fork"``): a bare cause leaves the person with a dead socket and
#: nothing to do. Review round 3, UX U3.
BIND_FAILED_REASON = "owner could not prepare this view; the session is alive — reconnect to retry"

#: Maximum bytes in one frame. Must equal the server's ``_MAX_LINE_BYTES``:
#: the writer refuses to exceed it and the reader refuses to read past it, so
#: two different numbers would mean a frame the owner considers sendable is one
#: this client cannot read.
_READ_LIMIT_BYTES = 1 << 20

#: Disconnect reason for a frame too large to read. Distinct from owner death
#: because the remedy is different in kind: the owner is alive and healthy, and
#: what failed is our ability to parse what it sent. Kept a named constant so a
#: host can tell the two apart rather than matching on prose.

    in :func:`fit_request_frame` rewrites a refusal's sentence: when the text

    Narrow, and deliberately still fixed: no in-tree producer emits an

#: available, the post-refit re-measure caught the overflow, and the whole
#: message was refused — including the ~780 KB screenshot this module's
#: docstring names as the motivating bug (review round 1, MAJOR-1).
#:
#: What remains is per-image JSON punctuation the emptied frame does not carry:

#: refit ran, on the premise that the tightest rung "lands around 20-30 KB of
#: base64" so a smaller budget guaranteed a per-image refusal. That premise
#: holds for continuous-tone photographs and is false for the two shapes an

#: image and a frame under the limit (review round 2, MAJOR-4) — the same class
#: of defect MAJOR-1 filed against the old fixed reserve, one layer up.
#:
#: So the refit ALWAYS runs, and this only decides which sentence a failure
#: gets. Below this much room the per-image refusal would quote a share
#: rounding to ``0.0 MB`` and point the user at a screenshot when only

async def fit_request_frame(frame: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Return ``frame`` sized to fit the socket, refitting its images if needed.

    THE BUG THIS CLOSES. The owner's control socket reads one JSON line per
    frame with ``limit=_MAX_LINE_BYTES``; a line over that makes its
    ``readline`` raise and (before the sibling fix in ``RuntimeServer``) killed
    the reader loop and the connection. Nothing on this side checked, so
    ``prompt``/``steer``/``slash`` put the user's images on the wire fully
    base64-encoded and unguarded, and ONE pasted screenshot over ~780 KB of
    source severed the socket at the moment of sending. Measured on this
    machine: a 1672x941 render is 1.23 MB of base64 after the composer's own
    ingest bound, and two ordinary screenshots together are 1.1 MB, so the
    frames that break it are ordinary rather than pathological.

    WHY REFIT RATHER THAN REFUSE. Pasting screenshots is a routine gesture, and
    the sizes above are routine too — a hard rejection would break the feature
    to protect the transport. So each image is re-encoded to fit
    (:func:`~local_operator.imaging.refit_image_to_budget`, JPEG at full
    resolution first, downscale only if that is not enough). Only an image that
    cannot fit even at its tightest rung is refused, named by the MARKER NUMBER
    on the user's own composer chip so they know which attachment to drop.

    WHY THE BUDGET IS SHARED ACROSS THE IMAGES. The line limit applies to the
    whole frame, so N images have to fit TOGETHER; refitting each against the
    full limit would pass N times and still overflow. What is left after the
    frame's MEASURED overhead is therefore split between them — see
    :func:`_refit_images` for why the split reclaims rather than divides flat.

    A COROUTINE because the refit decodes and re-encodes images — ~315 ms for a
    20 MP frame — and every caller is on an event loop. The work goes to a
    thread; a frame with no images (the overwhelming majority: every ack, every
    watch, every projection request) returns after one length check without
    ever reaching it.

    Publishes what the refit COST to :data:`_REFIT_REPORT` for the front end to
    render — see :func:`taken_refit_report`. Always, including the empty tuple
    when nothing was resized, so a reader cannot mistake a previous send's
    report for this one's.

    Raises :class:`OversizedRequest` when the frame cannot be made to fit,
    which is strictly better than the alternative: the caller learns its
    request was not sent while the connection is still alive.

    ONE unit system across the whole sentence family. The text refusal printed
    raw byte counts (``1,341,208 bytes``) while the image one printed MB, so two
    refusals raised from the same function asked the user to compare figures in
    different scales (design round 1, D1).

    MB at and above a full megabyte, KB below it, and the raw byte count below
    one KB. The KB floor is there because a one-decimal MB renders every small
    figure as ``0.0 MB`` — and the figures that go small here are exactly the
    per-image budgets a refusal is trying to explain. A budget the sentence
    prints as zero tells the user their image did not fit in nothing, which is
    not a fact they can act on; the same applies one scale down, where a
    ``1023 B`` share must not read ``0 KB``: the split walks smallest-first, so
    the LAST image of a many-attachment message can face a sub-KB share while
    its tightest rung is still over a KB, and that sentence has to state a
    budget the user can act on (review round 3, NIT-2 — previously only the
    exact-zero case had been noticed, which is unreachable; the share path is
    not).

    THE SWITCH IS AT 1024 KB, not at 0.1 MB, so the two scales cannot cross.
    Keyed on the rounded MB figure the sentence would actually print, the
    boundary sat mid-KB: ``104,857`` read ``102 KB`` and ``104,858`` read
    ``0.1 MB``, so a one-byte step moved the number DOWN while moving the unit
    up, and a user comparing two refusals a minute apart saw the smaller figure
    in the larger unit (review round 2, NIT-2). Below a full megabyte the
    KB figure is the honest one; at or above it the MB figure is.

    """Fit every image block into ``budget_bytes`` of base64 TOTAL, or refuse by name.

    Runs in a thread (see :func:`fit_request_frame`). A block that is not a
    dict, or carries no ``data_b64``, is passed through untouched: the owner
    already drops unusable blocks (``_images_from_wire``), and inventing a
    refusal for one here would fail a send over something the owner would have
    ignored. Its bytes still count against the budget, because they still ride
    the frame.

    THE BUDGET IS RECLAIMED, NOT DIVIDED FLAT. An equal ``budget // len(images)``
    share is the obvious split and it wastes the frame: a 32x32 icon reserved
    the same share as a 1600x1000 screenshot and handed nothing back, so the
    screenshot lost half its pixels while 59% of the frame went unspent (review
    round 1, MINOR-2). Images are therefore fitted SMALLEST FIRST, each against
    an equal share of what REMAINS divided by the images still to come, and
    whatever a small image does not spend is immediately available to the
    larger ones behind it. Smallest-first is what makes the reclaim monotone:
    an image under its share always passes untouched, so the leftover only ever
    grows as the walk proceeds.

    This keeps the property the flat split was chosen for \u2014 a message shrinks
    evenly rather than refusing its last attachment \u2014 because an image that
    genuinely needs more than its share still only gets its share when every
    other image is equally hungry.

    answering. It is wrong for a caller whose question is "is this pid hosting

    the live pid still carrying the previous conversation, and one refused dial

    A WEDGED RECORD ANSWERS ``True``, because that is the whole of "could this

    third state — the pid is alive and the heartbeat is older than

        THE CAPABILITY RESTORATION, CLIENT SIDE (revision 2, §2.4). Three frames
        reach the runtime that increase authority — ``slash``, ``slash_result``
        and ``approval_answer`` — and this client used to answer all three with a
        spawn capability it only has when THIS process started the runtime. Every
        other surface (an attached pane, the desktop backend for a session it did
        not engage, the CLI on a background-started run, the phone) could not
        loosen at all, which is the capability loss the operator will not accept.

        So when the capability is not available and the owner advertises
        ``operator-signature-v1``, the client asks the runtime for a per-action
        challenge and signs it with the operator key. The signature costs a

        prompt-free (design §3), and prompting it would be a regression in the
        one surface that already worked.

        THE MEMO IS POPPED, not read, and that is the single-use rule reaching

        user gesture, one frame) while a retry after a failure prompts again —
        which is correct, because a retry after a failure needs a new challenge
        anyway.

        RUN OFF THE EVENT LOOP, deliberately: the signing call raises the OS
        presence prompt (Touch ID, or CNG's consent dialog), which blocks until a
