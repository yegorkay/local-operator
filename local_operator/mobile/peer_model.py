"""Receive-side core for a peer switching THIS session's model (``peer_set_model``).

Both owner hosts answer the op — the TUI (``mobile/tui_handle.py``) and the
serving/exec runtime (``session/runtime/serving.py``) — and they must agree on
what counts as a servable pair and on every sentence a sender reads back. Those
sentences are a user-visible contract (design D2), so they are composed once,
here, and each host only supplies its own way of APPLYING the switch: the TUI
runs its own ``/model`` on the Textual thread, the runtime calls its
``set_model_effort``. Neither host mutates ``Session`` from the control
server's loop.

Import-light on purpose, like ``peer_send``: the validator and the credential
store are imported inside the functions that need them, so a handle module can
import this without dragging the model graph into its own import time.
