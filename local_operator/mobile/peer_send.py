"""Shared send-side core for peer-to-peer session messaging.

Both entry points that hand a message to another local ``lop`` session ride the
same substrate — the CLI command ``lop send`` (a short-lived child process) and
the in-session ``send`` tool (running inside the sender's own process) — and they
must agree on HOW a target is resolved and WHAT counts as a deliverable body.
Before this module existed that logic lived only in ``cli.py``, so the tool would
have had to re-implement it (and the two would drift). This is the single source
of truth for the send-side decision logic; the transport itself stays in
``peer_client.send_peer_message`` and the receive semantics stay in
``Session.receive_peer_message``.

Kept in ``mobile/`` next to ``peer_client`` because peer messaging is built on the
mobile control-socket + registry substrate (every interactive session publishes a
discovery record and runs an authenticated loopback control server). Import-light
on purpose: it pulls the registry and config path only, never the heavyweight
``Session`` graph, so a tool can import it without dragging the session in.

    """The ONE sentence that refuses a peer message to a never-engaged session.

    A session that has not run a real turn yet (``SessionRecord.started`` is
    False — the ``/new`` window where the record is published but the owner is
    still composing their first prompt) is not a recipient: a peer row landing
    there becomes the OPENING row of a conversation its owner never started,
    which is the operator-reported symptom this gate exists for.

    Three layers can each stop a delivery — resolution
    (:func:`resolve_peer_target`), delivery (:func:`deliver_peer_message`) and
    the receive-side gate (``session.runtime.server._dispatch``, the one that
    also holds against a sender on an older build) — and they use the SAME
    sentence, because a sender refused at one layer and retried into another
    must not have to learn a second rule. Only ``label`` varies, and it is
    written in the caller's own grammar — ``pid 12345`` where a live record
    gives us the pid the sender typed, ``session 'abc'`` for an id (see
    :func:`delivery_label` and the resolver's own ``f"pid {pid}"`` /
    ``f"session {session!r}"`` forms) — so the target the refusal names is the
    one that was addressed.

    The reason is stated as the FIX, not as a prohibition: the owner sends a
    first message and the session becomes eligible at that moment (the first
    turn publishes the flipped bit the resolver and the receive side both
    read). ``/stop`` never reads this — the kill switch passes
    ``require_started=False``, since a composer window is exactly a session a
    person may need to stop.

    ``count`` pluralises the sentence for a BATCHED refusal: a substring match
    that reached several unengaged sessions refuses them in one line, and
    "every … (4 of them)" with a singular tail disagrees with itself
    (design round 1, D3). ``cold`` swaps the remedy for a target with NO live
    runtime — a stored session: there, "its owner has to send a first message"
    presumes a window the sender cannot open, so the cold tail says the
    conversation has to be opened and used before it becomes a recipient
    (design round 1, D5). Both default to the single live form, which is what
    the exact-address sites want.

    Priority: ``pid`` (exact), ``session`` (exact session_id), then the ``target``
    substring matched case-insensitively against conversation_name, then
    session_id, then the cwd basename. An ALL-DIGIT ``target`` is tried as a
    pid first: the picker rows, ``lop sessions`` and every disambiguation
    line present the pid as the thing to retype, and a vocabulary whose
    listed form cannot be typed back is a dead end (found by the ``/stop``
    argument picker: every row it offered failed to resolve). Only when no
    record has that pid does the digit string fall through to the substring
    match, so a session id or name that happens to be numeric still works.

    Only ``live`` records are eligible (a record whose owner has stopped
    reporting for ``HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_S`` is not one a plain send should assume
    can be reached; ``stale`` is dead) — unless ``include_wedged``, which the
    kill switch passes: a session that is not answering is exactly the one a
    user needs to be able to STOP, and the stop ladder's signal rungs are built
    for a runtime that will not answer. A send never wants that; a message to
    such a runtime is a message that may sit unread.

    A record that has not run a real turn yet (``started`` False — the ``/new``
    composer window) is not a recipient, and ``require_started`` (default True)
    is where every send path enforces that: an EXACT ``pid``/``session``/all-digit
    address is refused with :func:`unengaged_refusal` naming it, and a SUBSTRING
    match skips it. Both halves matter and they fail differently: a broadcast
    that reached an unengaged session would drive an interrupt into a
    conversation nobody started, while an exact send that resolved to one would
    let a caller who named it explicitly land the first row of that history.
    The refusal for a substring match deliberately does NOT use the
    ``no live session matches`` phrasing: that form is what opens the stored
    fallback (``live_scan_found_nothing``), and a refusal about a session the
    live scan DID reach must never fall through to a stored namesake — the same
    wrong-recipient rule as the target+selector conflict below.

    ``require_started=False`` resolves an unengaged record exactly as a started
    one, and exists for the KILL SWITCH alone (``/stop``, ``lop stop`` in
    ``tui/app.py`` and ``cli.py``): a composer window is a session a person may
    need to stop, and a stop names its target rather than messaging it.
    Delivery is not reachable through it — ``deliver_peer_message`` refuses an
    unengaged target whatever the resolver allowed.

    A session that stops being unengaged needs no re-scan: the first real turn
    flips the record's ``started`` bit (``RuntimeServer.set_record_started``,
    published by the owner process), and this reads the record.

    Note what the wedged refusal is and is not. It is a rule about which target to
    DIAL, not a claim that the owner is broken: the beat is authored by the
    runtime's own event loop, so a busy session can read ``wedged`` too
    (``registry.classify``). The cost of being wrong that way is bounded and
    visible — a sender who addresses the session anyway gets the
    unconfirmed-delivery sentence (:func:`_unanswered_dial_detail`) rather than
    a silent loss.

    A selector (``pid``/``session``) alongside a ``target`` substring is REFUSED
    rather than resolved. The two name different sessions, and the precedence
    above would silently prefer the selector — delivering to a session the call
    does not appear to name, and reporting success. That is a wrong-recipient
    hazard, not an ergonomic wart, so it lives here in the shared core: a
    conflict rule that existed only in ``cli.py`` would falsify this module's
    claim to be the single source of truth and leave the ``send`` tool teaching
    a different rule from the command.

    ``capability`` names what an unengaged target cannot do in its refusal;
    the model switch passes :data:`MODEL_SWITCH_CAPABILITY` so its sender reads
    about a switch, not about peer messages.

    Returns ``(record, candidates, error)``: exactly one of ``record`` or
    ``error`` is meaningful; ``candidates`` is populated on an ambiguous substring
    so the caller can list them for disambiguation. The shape is identical for the
    CLI and the tool — only how each SURFACES the outcome differs.

    ``skipped`` is an OUT-PARAMETER, not a fourth tuple element, and it is how a
    substring match's HELD-BACK records reach the sender's receipt: a name that
    reached one engaged recipient may have passed over others, and the caller
    that delivered appends :func:`skipped_clause` so the success line says how
    many were left behind (design round 1, D1). Passing a list is opt-in on
    purpose — the three kill-switch callers pass ``require_started=False`` and
    so never hold anything back, an exact address names one record and can hold
    nothing back either, and a caller that ignores the list keeps exactly
    today's behaviour. This is a courtesy to a sender, never a gate: every
    refusal below fires whether or not anyone is listening.

    The conflict wording uses the caller's own ``pid_hint``/``session_hint``
    grammar for the same reason the "no target given" line does. The CLI never
    reaches these branches in practice — ``cli._bind_send_positionals`` refuses
    first, with a richer message that prints two retypeable command lines, and
    argparse's mutually-exclusive group rejects pid+session at parse time — so
    these are the tool's phrasing. Keeping them here anyway is the point: the
    rule holds for ANY caller, including one added later that has no parser in
    front of it.

    * the id is UNKNOWN to the scan (``no session found with session id …``):
      nothing published a record, so the store is a NEW question;
    * the record the scan found is STALE (``… is stale (its pid no longer

    Every OTHER form keeps standing as a refusal, and the difference is what

    searches discovery records, which only RUNNING sessions publish, so a note
    addressed to a session by the name it had before its terminal was closed
    found nothing at all. This searches the session store the same way the
    ``/resume`` picker lists it — :func:`resume.recent_session_rows` for the
    id/name ordering, one bounded read per row, subagent scratch sessions
    excluded — and applies the same case-insensitive substring rule the live
    path does, over name and session id (a stored session has no recoverable
    cwd — see :class:`StoredCandidate`).

    ``live_ids`` is an optional exclusion for callers that know which session
    ids already have a runtime; it exists for the id-collision case, where a
    stored row's id belongs to a live session and a cold delivery would queue
    behind a process that could have been dialled. The CLI and the tool pass
    none: they enter this fallback only on :func:`live_scan_found_nothing`, so
    no live NAME match can have survived to here, and a stored row and its
    live session read their name from the same transcript — a collision that
    differs by name is a rename-timing edge, not a case worth a second
    registry scan on every stored send to catch.

    A row whose session has NO durable history is skipped rather than returned:
    such a session was never engaged, so it is not a recipient either — the
    stored half of the same rule the live resolver applies with
    ``require_started``. The read is one :func:`session_has_durable_history`
    pass per MATCHING row only, and the no-match answer is unchanged.

    Returns ``(session_id, candidates, error)`` shaped like
    :func:`resolve_peer_target`'s triple for symmetry, with one deliberate
    difference: a plain no-match still leaves ``error`` empty. A plain no-match
    is not this function's fact to report — the caller just watched the live
    scan miss, so the refusal it owes the user names BOTH searches ("searched
    live and stored sessions"), a sentence only the caller can say. What is this
    function's fact to report is the OTHER empty answer: rows that DID match and
    were withheld for being unengaged (review round 1, F-4). The caller's
    "no session matches '<needle>'" sentence would be false there — a session
    does answer to that name, it is merely not a recipient yet — so the refusal
    names the withheld row and says why, and the callers pass it through instead
    of composing their own miss. The first or the second element is meaningful,
    never both; the resolved id feeds the EXISTING :func:`resolve_cold_session`
    / :func:`deliver_peer_message` path — this function decides WHO, never HOW a
    message is delivered.

    Looks ``lookup_pid`` up in the registry and copies its conversation/model/
    session id so the target's indicator can name the sender honestly. When no
    record is found the process ANCESTRY is walked upward (bounded by
    :data:`_ANCESTRY_MAX_HOPS`, stopping at pid 1) and the first ancestor that
    published a record wins — the sender pid reported is then that ancestor's,
    because the pid on the card must name the session the reader can go and
    talk to, not the transient shell in between.

    Why the walk: testing only the immediate parent made identity fragile in
    exactly the cases that matter. ``lop send`` invoked from a subagent's bash
    tool, through a shell wrapper, or under ``nohup`` is a grandchild or lower,
    so the lookup missed and the card rendered ``peer message from (pid 1)``:
    no name, no model, nothing to follow in a busy transcript.

    What it does NOT fix: a genuinely REPARENTED sender. Once init has adopted
    the process its chain to the session is gone from the process table, so
    there is nothing left to walk and no amount of hops recovers it — that case
    still arrives pid-only. It is covered on the other side instead:
    :func:`resolve_sender_identity` resolves the sender against the receiver's
    own registry, and the card falls back to the cwd basename. This walk claims
    only the intact-chain cases.

    Blocking (a registry scan and a ``ps`` per hop). Callers on an event loop
    must use :func:`peer_sender_identity_async`.

    When nothing is found we still carry the original pid; the identity is
    advisory, never load-bearing for delivery.

    The pid to start from is the CALLER's decision because the two entry points
    run in different processes relative to the session: ``lop send`` is a
    short-lived CHILD of the TUI, so the CLI starts at ``os.getppid()``, while
    the in-session ``send`` tool runs INSIDE the session, so it starts at
    ``os.getpid()`` and matches on the first hop.
