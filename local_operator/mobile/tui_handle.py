"""The TUI's side of the mobile bridge.

:class:`TuiSessionHandle` adapts a running :class:`~local_operator.tui.app.OperatorApp`
to the session runtime's :class:`~local_operator.session.runtime.server.SessionHandle`
contract, so a phone can drive the same session the terminal is showing.

Two rules shape everything here:

- **Textual owns its thread.** Every mutation of app state goes through
  ``app.call_from_thread`` (the registrant's methods run on its own loop);
  reads of plain Python session state are safe directly.
- **The runtime's loop never waits on another thread.** ``call_from_thread``
  ENQUEUES the callback and then blocks until Textual runs it, so calling it
  directly from a coroutine parks the runtime's loop — and with it the accept,
  the welcome, ``ping`` and the heartbeat, all of which that one loop owns —
  for as long as the app is busy. Every hop therefore goes through
  :meth:`TuiSessionHandle._on_app`, which performs the blocking enqueue on a
  worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) and awaits the *bound* result
  (:meth:`_on_app` states the measured failure this prevents).
- **The phone is a second front end, not a second session.** Prompts,
  interrupts, model switches and slash commands route through the app's own
  code paths (``_submit_prompt``, ``_interrupt``, ``_run_slash_command`` …)
  so the terminal screen reflects everything the phone did — the user walking
  back to their desk sees the turn they started from the phone, mid-stream.

Ask prompts are answerable from the phone. When the TUI mounts an ``ask``
picker, the app calls :meth:`note_ask_pending`, which projects the first
question as a ``kind="ask"`` :class:`PendingRequest` (mirroring the daemon's
:mod:`owned` ask gate); the phone renders the card and can answer it via the
``ask_answer`` control op. :meth:`ask_answer` resolves the LIVE picker through
its own ``settle`` path on the Textual loop, so the terminal screen comes down
too and exactly one answer wins whichever front end got there first. When the
picker settles by any route, :meth:`note_ask_settled` clears the phone card.

Protocol-v4 full-TUI followers can answer approvals mounted by the host TUI.
The approval is carried as follower-only pending state (never added to daemon
projection frames, preserving the phone path byte-for-byte) and
:meth:`approval_answer` resolves the host's real ``ApprovalPrompt`` on the
Textual loop, so exactly one front end wins.

        waiting for an answer: it runs in the runtime's ``_serve_frontend_sync``
        task, no request is parked on it, and the connection is already usable

        ``frontend_sync_pending`` keeps everything heavier refused until it
        lands. Giving it the interactive budget therefore bought nothing and cost
        the session: with a busy terminal, a viewer was welcomed in 0.00 s and
        then KILLED at exactly 10.01 s (the bind's expiry took the whole

        died), measured twice, the second time with no other client attached. The
        parent had no bound here and its viewer was still served at +26.6 s into
        a 25 s freeze, so bounding it was a regression in this PR's own case.

        bare ``/stop`` takes in this app (deny gates → abort → dispose →
        release the lease → tear the registrant down → show the session
        cold with the ``/resume`` receipt), and the process survives with
        the session ended beneath it. Without this hook the ladder saw a
        runtime that "cannot stop itself gracefully", confirmed identity
        over this very socket, and SIGTERMed the terminal (seen live: every
        open ``lop`` window died on ``lop stop --all``).

        Scheduled, not awaited: the stop tears down the registrant that is
        serving THIS request, so awaiting its completion from inside the
        dispatch would hold the socket open past the point where anything
        can answer on it. The ack means "underway"; the ladder's exit-wait

        unpublished — ``_await_pid_exit`` is what makes the caller observe
        the session as gone, through the reaped record on its next scan.

        THE RECEIPT DOES NOT WAIT FOR THE APP LOOP (review round 1, UX U2).
        It used to: the hop into Textual was awaited, so the reply arrived only
        once the app had run the scheduling step — which is precisely the work
        a BUSY app cannot service. Measured over a real socket on a working
        session, rung 1 of the ladder timed out at its 15 s
        (``OwnerAckTimeout``) and ``lop stop`` escalated to the signal rung,
        killing a host whose hook would have ended the session politely
        (exit 143). A receipt is a STATEMENT about what is about to happen, not
        a report of work completed, so it is built here from identity reads and
        the hop that PERFORMS the stop is detached (``_detach_stop_hop``). The
        ladder's record reap is still the confirmation, so an early ack cannot

        typed. The producer is a coroutine, so it is scheduled on the app loop
        and its completion awaited here.

        That await used to be genuinely unbounded, to let an MCP grant's
        browser round trip finish. It never worked: the invoking client gives
        up after ``ACK_TIMEOUT_S`` (15 s), so a grant that waited on a human
        left the follower with a timeout while the exchange ran on invisibly.

        ``locality`` is the invoking client's declared position; it is passed

        cannot carry `/approvals auto` must not be offered it by the report the
        app builds on its behalf. It comes from the registrant's seam, which is
        the only place that knows what this connection may do.

        ``consumers`` is forwarded for the same reason and to the same end as
        on ``ServingSessionHandle``: a session can be hosted either by a detached
        runtime or by this app, and a follower must get the same answer from
        both. A viewer that does not consume action-carrying receipts has its

        the Textual loop via :meth:`_on_app`: the pending-map read, the
        single-winner guard, and the picker advance/settle all run there,
        against the one loop that also mounts and settles the card. That is
        what makes the race safe without locking — by the time this callback
        runs, either the picker is still live (answer it) or the terminal
        already answered (``settled`` is set / the entry is gone).

        Multi-question asks advance question-by-question (U1). A phone answer
        drives the picker's own :meth:`AskPickerScreen.answer_current`, the
        external-answer twin of the terminal's Enter: it records this question's
        answer and either advances the SAME picker to the next question — in
        which case we RE-PROJECT the new current question so the phone shows it
        — or, on the last question, settles the whole card. Settling resolves
        the very future ``request_user_choice`` awaits, so the terminal screen
        also comes down and the tool call returns the full answer map.

        ``question_index`` is the question the phone was DISPLAYING when the user
        tapped. It is the U8 guard, mirroring the composer path's
        ``_HeldAnswerKey.question_index``: a multi-question picker advances (and
        the phone re-projects) between answers, so a tap already in flight when
        a terminal advance lands must NOT be recorded against the question that
        moved into its place. We refuse when it no longer matches the picker's
        live index rather than misattribute the value; the phone then repaints
        to the current question from the re-projection. ``None`` (an older
        client) skips the check and answers the current question, the pre-guard
        behaviour.

        Race message (U4): if the terminal (or a stop/teardown) already settled
        this card, report that it was "already answered on the terminal" — a
        human, reconciling message rather than the developer-worded "no longer

        """Run ``fn`` on the Textual thread and await its result, BOUNDED —
        and WITHOUT parking the runtime's loop on the way there.

        ``call_from_thread`` does not merely enqueue: it ENQUEUES AND THEN
        BLOCKS until Textual runs the callback. Called directly from this
        coroutine, that blocking enqueue happens on whichever thread is awaiting
        us — and for a TUI-hosted runtime that thread is the runtime's own
        event loop, so the loop stops accepting connections, stops answering
        ``ping``, stops pushing projections and stops writing the heartbeat for
        as long as the app is busy. Measured on 2026-09-18 (a real
        ``OperatorApp`` + ``RuntimeServer(kind="tui")``, the app loop held with
        a synchronous ``time.sleep``): with one client registered, the control
        thread sat inside this function's enqueue for 49.6 s while the app was
        held 50.5 s; a fresh dial got no welcome within 20 s (and the client's
        own ``ACK_TIMEOUT_S`` is 15 s), and the discovery record's heartbeat
        crossed the 45 s timeout into ``wedged`` at hold+43 s, peaking at
        52.5 s — on a pid that was alive and idle. With NO client registered the
        same 20 s hold was harmless (beat 5.1 s, ``live``), which is what
        identifies the hop — not a slow turn — as the cause.

        ``asyncio.to_thread`` is what puts the blocking enqueue INSIDE the
        bound: the runtime's loop only awaits the worker thread, so it stays
        runnable and keeps serving every OTHER connection and its own loops
        while this one hop waits. The pattern is the same one already used two
        modules away for the viewer-resume hop (``tui/app.py``: "`to_thread` is
        what puts the blocking enqueue INSIDE the bound").

        THE BOUND, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. The wait here is bounded by ONE
        budget of :data:`_APP_HOP_TIMEOUT_S` covering the whole hop — the
        blocking enqueue AND the callback's awaited result. That is a
        correction of what this docstring said in review round 1 (MAJOR 1): the
        first version claimed the pre-existing ``wait_for`` around the *future*
        had "become a real bound", which it could not, because
        ``call_from_thread`` returns only once Textual has RUN the callback —
        so the ENQUEUE await is what has to sit inside the bound, and the
        future-await that follows is only the scheduling tail. It still does
        not RECALL an enqueue that is already parked: Textual cannot cancel a
        queued callback, so on expiry the callback runs anyway on the app loop
        and ``_set_unless_done`` drops its result. What expires is how long
        THIS caller waits — what a stuck app produces is an error the caller
        can report, instead of a wedge it waits out forever. The residual cost
        is one parked worker thread per expired hop until the app drains its
        queue, bounded by the executor's own ``max_workers``; before this
        change that same wait was paid by the runtime's loop instead, taking
        the control socket down with it.

        AN AWAITABLE RESULT IS AWAITED (review round 1, U1). Several callbacks
        handed to this method are async on the session
        (``refresh_attention``, ``acknowledge_attention``, ``record_shell``),
        so ``fn()`` returns a coroutine OBJECT. Handing that back as the answer
        is not a harmless no-op: it stored a coroutine in
        ``Projection.attention``, after which every projection push failed to
        serialize — the FIRST viewer was dropped the moment a SECOND dialled
        (reproduced by UX round 1 over a real socket with the product's own
        attach clients, and identically at 2484cfa4, which is what marks it
        pre-existing rather than new here), and ``record_shell``'s write silently
        never ran at all. An awaitable result is therefore scheduled as a task ON
        the app loop and this caller is settled with ITS result.

        ``budget=None`` MEANS NO BUDGET, and it is for the one caller that is
        not a client waiting for an answer: the canonical frontend bind
        (:meth:`subscribe_frontend`, reached from the runtime's
        ``_serve_frontend_sync``). See that method for why an interactive budget
        must not apply there — UX round 2 measured what applying it costs
        (a viewer welcomed in 0.00 s and then killed at exactly 10.01 s because
        the terminal was busy, with the product reporting its session as dead).
