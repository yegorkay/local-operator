"""Model configuration on top of the new provider layer.

Rewritten for the harness rewrite (docs/REWRITE.md §B). The public surface
legacy code depends on is preserved:

- :class:`ModelConfiguration` (plus ``.spec``, the harness ``ModelSpec``).
- :func:`configure_model` — same signature, returns a ``ModelConfiguration``.
- :func:`validate_model` — same endpoints as the legacy if/elif chain, now a
  per-provider descriptor table.
- :func:`calculate_cost`, ``DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE``, ``DEFAULT_TOP_P``.

New: :func:`create_stream_fn` builds the ``LoopConfig.stream_fn`` from an
:class:`~local_operator.providers.auth_store.AuthStore`, resolving API keys
and dispatching to the right wire client through
:func:`~local_operator.providers.failover.stream_with_failover`.

#: Model families that reject ``temperature``/``top_p`` outright.

#: ``temperature`` is dropped, so both have to go together. Verified live
#: against ``api.anthropic.com/v1/messages``: ``claude-opus-5`` and
#: ``claude-sonnet-5`` 400 on either parameter and 200 with neither, while
#: ``claude-opus-4-5``/``claude-sonnet-4-5``/``claude-haiku-4-5`` accept both —
#: hence the generation digit must sit directly after the tier, or the trailing
#: ``-5`` of the 4.5 models would match and silently lose their sampling
#: settings. ``[5-9]|\d{2,}`` reads forward rather than pinning to 5: a future
#: ``claude-opus-6`` is far likelier to keep the deprecation than to revert it,
#: and the two failure directions are not symmetric — a false negative makes
#: the model unusable on every single turn, a false positive only falls back to
#: the provider's own sampling defaults.
#:
#: OpenAI's o-series and ``gpt-5`` reject the same pair on both
#: ``/chat/completions`` and ``/responses``. This is deliberately NOT keyed on
#: the ``reasoning`` flag below even though it overlaps: ``reasoning`` also
#: matches the ``thinking``/``reasoner`` suffixes, and Gemini and DeepSeek

#: trade a loud 400 for a silent loss of a real setting, which is the worse

# The Claude arm matches ANY tier name at generation 5 and above, not a fixed

#: The per-family SAMPLING POLICY table: what this app may assert about
#: ``temperature``/``top_p``, keyed on the MODEL id.
#:
#: **The defect this table exists to fix.** The app shipped a hardcoded
#: ``temperature=0.2``/``top_p=0.9`` to every provider on every turn. That pair
#: is not a conservative default — it is an INVENTED number asserted over each
#: vendor's own documented one, and a survey of the primary docs found not a
#: single major vendor whose default is anywhere near it (essentially all are
#: 1.0, with top_p 0.95). Several current families reject the parameter with a
#: hard 400, and several more accept it and silently ignore it. The reported
#: symptom was Gemini 3 looping, but that was one visible face of a general bug.
#:
#: **Why OMIT is the default answer rather than a seeded number.** An absent key
#: resolves to whatever the vendor currently considers correct, so a vendor
#: retune reaches users for free and the value can never drift stale. It is also
#: literally what Google's migration guide prescribes ("removing this
#: parameter"), and it drops an assertion this app never earned. Sending an
#: explicit value is not even neutral on aggregators: OpenRouter notes a sent
#: value "may differ from omitting it (for example, it can affect provider-side
#: cache keys)". A row therefore SEEDS a number only where the vendor documents
#: something we cannot obtain by staying silent.
#:
#: **Why the rows are keyed on the model, not the provider.** Same reasoning
#: already argued for :data:`_NO_SAMPLING_PARAMS` below: a sampling contract is
#: a property of the model, and the same weights answer on the direct route, on
#: OpenRouter and on Radient. A provider-keyed rule would fix one route and
#: leave the aggregator routes carrying the bug — which is what users actually
#: hit.
#:
#: **Independent knobs.** ``temperature`` and ``top_p`` are decided separately
#: per row because vendors diverge on them constantly (Qwen documents 0.7 with
#: top_p 0.8; Gemini 2.5 is 1.0/0.95). ``None`` means OMIT.
#:
#: Patterns read FORWARD over the generation digit (``[7-9]|\d{2,3}``) rather
#: than pinning to today's numbers: a newer generation is far likelier to keep a
#: restriction than to revert it, and the failure directions are asymmetric — a
#: false negative is a 400 or a loop on every turn, a false positive only falls
#: back to the vendor's own default. ``[.-]`` matches both spellings vendors
#: ship (``gemini-3-flash`` and ``gemini-3.8-flash``), mirroring
#: ``model/effort.py``; the ``\d{2,3}`` bound and ``(?!\d)`` guard stop an
#: 8-digit snapshot date reading as a generation number, the exact trap
#: ``_EFFORT_TABLE`` documents. Unanchored, so an aggregator prefix
#: (``google/…``) and ``:free``/``-preview``/``-thinking`` suffixes still match.
#:
#: SCOPED TO CHAT/COMPLETION sampling. Every row is derived from a vendor's
#: chat-model documentation, and ``routes/speech.py`` is a second consumer that
#: resolves speech ids (``whisper-1``, ``gpt-4o-mini-tts``) through the same
#: table. Today they all reach the OMIT fallback, which is correct for them, so
#: this is a caveat rather than a defect — but a speech id sharing a prefix with
#: a chat family would inherit reasoning that was never about speech endpoints,
#: and that is the point at which this table needs a speech-aware branch rather
#: than another row.
#:
#: FIRST MATCH WINS, so a narrower row must precede a broader one.
#: A family's sampling rule: the seeded ``temperature``/``top_p`` (``None``
#: meaning "send no key"), plus whether the vendor REJECTS a value it did not
#: ask for.
#:
#: ``rejects`` is a third state rather than a second ``None``, because the two
#: reasons to send nothing have opposite consequences for an explicit override,
#: and conflating them reopens the exact outage this table exists to close:
#:
#: * Vendor IGNORES the value (Gemini 3.x). Our default assertion is pointless,
#:   so we drop it — but a user or agent that deliberately sets one loses
#:   nothing by having it sent, so the escape hatch stays open.
#: * Vendor REJECTS the value (Anthropic ≥4.7: "all other values will be
#:   rejected with a 400 error"; OpenAI GPT-6: "Remove `temperature`,
#:   `top_p`"). An override here is not a preference, it is a turn that fails
#:   EVERY time. A stored agent ``temperature`` is the shape the server's own
#:   API examples advertise, so this is an ordinary path, not an exotic one.
#:
#: Note this cannot be expressed by comparing against a ``(None, None)``
#: sentinel: equal constant tuples are interned to one object, so two such
#: sentinels would be indistinguishable by identity and silently collapse into
#: each other.

#: The effort ladder an AGGREGATOR ROUTER route (``auto`` / ``openrouter/auto``)
#: offers, and the level it starts on.
#:
#: WHY A ROUTE-KEYED RULE, not an id-keyed ``model.effort`` table row. That
#: table is keyed on the MODEL id precisely so a route cannot change the knob
#: (``anthropic/claude-opus-5`` through an aggregator is the same weights as the
#: direct route). A router's id breaks that premise: ``auto`` is not a model at
#: all, and the same word is a LOCAL model on ``ollama/auto`` (see
#: ``discovery.is_meta_route_id``, which takes the provider for this reason).
#: So the router's ladder belongs to the ROUTE, and the route is exactly what
#: ``registry.AGGREGATOR_ROUTER_MODEL_IDS`` names.
#:
#: WHY THIS VOCABULARY. The router's product is dispatching to a frontier model
#: chosen per request, so the honest ladder is the one the AGGREGATOR documents
#: for the ``reasoning_effort`` parameter it fronts -- the three real depths
#: low/medium/high, which is both OpenAI's canonical value set and the set
#: Radient's own OpenAI-compatible request schema names for the field
#: (``internal/requests/openai.go``: "Constrains reasoning effort (low, medium,
#: high)"), PLUS the ``auto`` sentinel on the aggregators whose server resolves
#: it (see the provider split below). The alternative -- the
#: rungs of whichever model the router selects today (``deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash``
#: takes none/low/high/max) -- would pin this table to a selection that is random
#: by design and would offer rungs a future route rejects. A level the selected
#: model does not itself offer is mapped to the nearest rung it does by the
#: aggregator, so an aggregator-wide ladder cannot 400; the current route's own
#: top rung, ``high``, is on both sets, which is what the operator requires the
#: wire to carry.
#:
#: WHY THE LADDER IS SPLIT BY AGGREGATOR, and why the split is load-bearing
#: rather than cosmetic. The two routers front different request schemas.
#: Radient's own OpenAI-compatible schema is now readonly for an explicit
#: ``auto`` sentinel -- the SERVER interprets ``"auto"`` and resolves it to a
#: real depth (see the agent-server ``resolveEffort`` seam) -- so the ladder
#: the harness offers on ``radient``/``radient-key`` carries ``auto`` as its
#: floor AND its default. OpenRouter does NOT: it validates ``reasoning_effort``
#: against an enum it defines and rejects values outside it (measured: openclaw
#: issue #77350; it 400s on an unknown enum member), and it documents no
#: ``auto`` member, so its ladder stays the three canonical rungs and its
#: default stays ``high`` -- the level the route's current model documents.
#: One shared ladder would either 400 every OpenRouter router turn on ``auto``
#: or leave Radient's sentinel unreachable; keyed on the PROVIDER is the only
#: spelling that keeps both routes legal.

    # reasoning tokens of omitting the key (n=12 per arm, real 200s), and
    # `mistralai/mistral-small-2603` went from a median 0 reasoning tokens
    # omitted to 167.5 with its stated `high` sent. It is also model-specific
    # (`gemini-3.8-flash` measured 0.93x, a genuine no-op), so no general
    # equivalence can be relied on — which is what a seeding rule would need.
    #
    # Why the TABLE's default does not seed there either, which is the subtler
    # half. That seed rests on Anthropic documenting `effort:"high"` as exactly
    # equivalent to omitting the parameter — but that is a documented fact about
    # ANTHROPIC'S OWN API, and on an aggregator we are not talking to it.
    # OpenRouter interposes its own reasoning gate ahead of the upstream model
    # (it publishes the gate as `reasoning.default_enabled`), and that gate
    # changes the answer. Measured, same prompt, n=10 per arm, real 200s:
    #
    #     anthropic/claude-opus-4.6     omitted   0 reasoning tokens (min 0, max 0)
    #                                   'high'   70                 (min 61, max 73)
    #     anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6   omitted   0
    #                                   'high'  164                 (min 146, max 176)
    #     anthropic/claude-opus-5       omitted  65   'high'  67.5   <- equivalent here
    #
    # Those counts are PROMPT-DEPENDENT and are not constants of the model. The
    # arms above share one reasoning-demanding prompt, which is what makes them
    # comparable to each other; re-measured on a trivial one-line prompt, QA got
    # 0 for BOTH arms of `opus-4.6` (n=10) and 0 vs 267 on a different demanding
    # prompt. What reproduces is the DIRECTION and the asymmetry — omission
    # yields no reasoning where `high` yields some — and that is the whole basis
    # of the rule below. A future reader re-measuring with a one-liner will see
    # smaller or zero figures on both arms and should not read that as the table
    # being wrong, or "fix" the rule back on the strength of it.
    #
    # So on that route sending `high` does not restate a default, it switches
    # reasoning ON — the same defect measured for listing defaults, arriving
    # through the table instead. We therefore assert the equivalence only on the
    # route whose documentation establishes it, and omit everywhere else.
    # Omitting is the one choice that is safe without a claim: it is what the
    # user gets today if they never touch the dial, and one keystroke sets a
    # real rung.
    #
    # THE ROUTER IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, and the measurements above do not reach
    # it. Every argument in this block is about a NAMED model reached through an
    # aggregator: the seed would be a second-hand claim about a model whose own
    # API we are not talking to, and the aggregator's gate makes omission and a
    # level meaningfully different. The router is not a model — it is one
    # endpoint this module ships a row for, whose PRODUCT is dispatching to a
    # frontier model per request. On ``radient/auto`` there is no upstream model
    # to make a claim about: the level is an instruction to the router, which
    # maps it to whatever the selected route accepts. The operator's decision is
    # that the harness EMITS this level on that route rather than leaving the
    # dial invisible, and ``high`` is the level the current route's own model
    # documents as its default — so the emitted body states the depth already in
    # force on today's route rather than switching reasoning on. The exception is
    # scoped to the router id on an aggregator hosting (see
    # ``aggregator_router_effort_ladder``); every OTHER aggregator id, including
    # a vendor model genuinely named ``auto`` on a non-aggregator hosting, keeps
    # the omit rule above.
    #
    # What this costs, stated plainly: 8 OpenRouter Anthropic rows that boot
    # showing `high` today (`claude-opus-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-fable-5*`
    # and their `:batch` twins) now boot showing `auto`. That is wire-neutral —
    # opus-5 measured 65 vs 67.5 tokens — and the band stops asserting a level
    # we cannot substantiate on that route. The direct `anthropic::claude-opus-5`
    # route is untouched and still seeds `high`.
    #
    # The wire delta that remains, stated exactly rather than as "none". On the
    # AGGREGATOR route no model sends a key it was not already sending: the
    # dotted-id repair in `model.effort` gives ~9 Anthropic ids the ladder they
    # should always have had, and they gain that ladder while sending nothing.
    # On the DIRECT Anthropic route those same dotted spellings do newly seed
    # `high` — but there the documented equivalence genuinely applies, because
    # that is the API the documentation describes. It reaches no shipped
    # registry row (all 18 are hyphenated and verified byte-identical to base);
    # it is only reachable by typing a dotted id by hand, which previously got
    # no ladder at all.
    # `AGGREGATOR_PROVIDERS`, not `PUBLIC_LISTING_PROVIDERS`: the question here
    # is whether something sits between us and the model's own API, not whether
    # its catalogue happens to be readable without a key. The two sets are equal

       id — see :func:`anthropic_family_model_info`. This is what keeps a dated
       snapshot of a shipped model (``claude-opus-5-20260112``) on its family's
       real 1M window instead of a family-blind floor.
    3. A per-provider template.

    The global ``unknown_model_info`` is the right answer only for a provider we
    know nothing structural about. For Anthropic it is actively wrong: an unshipped
    Claude id would keep 128k/8192/no-cache — numbers no Claude generation has ever
    had. The template carries the family floor instead, in the same shape
    ``openrouter_default_model_info`` and ``radient_default_model_info`` already use
    for the aggregators.

    The template's id and name are overwritten so a placeholder shared by every
    unknown id of a provider cannot leak its identity ("Anthropic Claude") into a
    band that is meant to name the model the session is running. A family resolver
    owns those two fields itself, because only it knows whether the match was the
    same model under another spelling (keep the real name) or a newer generation
    inheriting limits (the name would be a lie).

    The same overwrite applies to the global ``unknown_model_info`` singleton.
    Returning it as-is is how a live xAI listing that carries a 500k window and
    no display name painted the status band ``Unknown``: discovery copies the
    fallback, fills the window, and keeps the placeholder's name because an
    empty listing name is treated as "no name" rather than "this model is

    THE one resolution path, so the numbers a session runs on and the numbers a
    UI prices with cannot disagree. ``_cost_for`` in the TUI used to call
    ``get_model_info`` directly and therefore saw zero prices for every
    aggregator model — the session had already resolved the real ones, and the
    status band still rendered "cost unavailable".

    Memoized in-process because callers are per-turn: the disk cache alone still
    costs a JSON parse (~25ms) per call, which is real latency inside a render.

    The memo's staleness is BOUNDED by one TTL window rather than pinned to the
    disk file's own age, and the distinction is worth being precise about. The
    file expires on AGE — 24h since its own ``fetched_at`` — while the memo
    expires on a wall-clock window aligned to epoch multiples of the TTL, i.e.
    at 00:00 UTC for the default. So when ANOTHER process refreshes the file
    mid-window, this process keeps serving the pre-refresh numbers until its
    window rolls. That is the same order of staleness as the disk cache, which is
    all this needs to be; what it replaces is a bare ``lru_cache`` whose
    staleness was unbounded, pinning boot-time metadata in a server for as long
    as it ran. Bounded at 64 entries because model ids are user-supplied — a
    typo per turn must not grow the map without limit.

    A switch to a DIFFERENT model needs no invalidation: the id is part of the
    key, so it simply misses. :func:`invalidate_model_info_cache` handles the
    other direction, where the SAME key should be re-resolved because the reason
    it degraded (a missing credential) has just been fixed.

    Every caller gets its OWN copy. ``ModelInfo`` is a mutable pydantic model and
    the registry hands out module-level singletons, so handing back the memo entry
    made ``config.info.context_window = ...`` in one session rewrite the shipped
    registry for every later session in the process — the server and the TUI both
    resolve many models in one process. The copy is a few dozen field assignments
    against the ~25ms JSON parse this memo exists to avoid.

        specific prefix — "this host was given these exact tokens and returned
        no reuse". A compaction rewrites the transcript into a summary, so the
        prefix those claims were made about no longer exists and the evidence
        is void: a host barred on the old prefix has never been asked about the
        new one, and `provider.ignore` has no removal path of its own, so
        without this a good host stays barred for the rest of the conversation
        (and for every fork of it) on evidence that expired.

        Cleared for EVERY model, not just the compacting request's: the prefix
        is the conversation's, and a sibling model's retirements were learned
        against that same replaced transcript. Over-clearing costs at most two
        turns of re-discovery; under-clearing permanently bars a host that
        caches, which is the failure this fixes.

        turn after a compaction is strike 1, so a host that then suffers ONE
        ordinary eviction is retired on what is effectively a single genuine
        miss rather than two. Left as is on evidence that cuts against the
        pessimistic reading: the first post-boundary turn is usually WARM, not
        cold — its prefix is the system blocks the host still holds plus the new
        summary, and the floor is ``max(1024, 2%)``, so above a ~1-2k system
        prefix that turn clears the floor and CLEARS the record instead of
        striking it. The blast radius is bounded by ``MAX_RETIRED_PROVIDERS``
        and the next compaction lifts the bar again, so this is strictly better
        than not clearing at all — which is the failure that made the clear

        "First configured" alone is what replayed the waterfall on every
        message boundary: with the chain's head providers down, each quota
        preflight re-selected the first entry, re-pinned it, and the stream
        walk then re-paid one failure notice and one serial timeout per dead
        target before landing back on the one provider that had actually been
        serving. Targets the stream driver recently benched (see
        ``FailoverRouteState.mark_target_failed``) are therefore passed over
        here, so a session that has settled on a working fallback stays on it.

        A target whose provider is *quota-depleted* is skipped the same way:
        pinning a maxed Kimi/Qwen hop just to watch it fail (or, worse, to
        treat its last 10% as another reason to hop) is how the cascade
        burned past a provider that still had spendable quota. Reserve is
        still usable — only a 0% remaining verdict skips. Unknown/unreachable
        usage fails open, matching preflight's own contract.

        The bench (and the depleted skip) is a preference, not a verdict:
        when EVERY authed candidate is benched or depleted, the first of
        them is returned anyway — returning ``None`` would report "no
        configured fallback" to a user who has several, and the stream
        walk's own retry machinery is the right place to discover which
        bench has expired.

        ``quota_cache`` is the memo of provider+model availability verdicts.
        It belongs to the CALLER's boundary walk, not to one invocation: a
        preflight that rotates through several accounts calls this once per
        rotation step, and a per-call cache re-probed every fallback
        provider's usage endpoint on each of them — a three-account
        Anthropic pool re-asked Kimi three times for one message boundary
        (review F7). The verdicts cannot disagree within a walk anyway: they
        are derived from usage reports fetched over a few hundred
        milliseconds, and ``_provider_quota_availability`` enumerates blocked
        rows too, so the recovery walk lifting a block mid-boundary does not
        change what a re-probe would answer. ``None`` keeps the standalone
        contract for a caller with no walk of its own.

        Collapses a concurrent peer's duplicate fetch of the SAME account (the 429
        storm this fixes) while keeping every boundary free to re-probe live —
        ``leased_account_usage`` never serves a fresh row on the fast path. Fails open
        to a live fetch when the cache is unavailable, so routing can never be made
        WORSE than the pre-cache behaviour. See docs/specs/preflight-usage-cache.md.

        ``usage_memo`` is the boundary walk's per-ACCOUNT report memo, and it is the
        layer that stops one boundary asking the same account's usage endpoint twice.
        It is needed IN ADDITION to the two memos the walk already carries, because
        neither covers this:

        * ``attempted_ids`` dedupes credential rows the walk has JUDGED, but the
          rows enumerated by ``_provider_quota_availability`` (a fallback-chain
          question) are not judgements and are deliberately not recorded there.
        * ``quota_cache`` dedupes provider+model VERDICTS, and cannot be widened:
          a Fable hop and an Opus hop on one Anthropic pool legitimately disagree
          because their binding windows differ.

        The underlying per-account REPORT is identical for both, though — it is one
        GET against one account — so memoizing the report is sound where sharing the
        verdict is not. Measured: a reserve-state account on a chain that lists its
        own provider was fetched twice per boundary (once by the primary probe, once
        by ``_provider_quota_availability`` via ``_first_available_fallback``).

        The cross-process cache cannot collapse this. ``leased_account_usage``
        deliberately never serves a fresh row on its fast path so a routing probe can
        notice recovery on its own next boundary; that contract is right ACROSS
        boundaries and is exactly what leaves the duplication WITHIN one.

        A ``None`` result is memoized like any other: every caller treats it as
        fail-open (unknown usage, keep the existing verdict), so replaying it inside
        one boundary reaches the same conservative outcome the re-probe would — while
        a re-probe of an endpoint that failed milliseconds ago is precisely the burst
        that earns a 429. Freshness is unaffected: the memo lives only for this
        boundary walk and is discarded with it.

        Returns True when the caller should re-resolve credentials (a sibling
        account took over), False when the routing decision is final.

        ``quota_cache`` is the caller's boundary-walk memo of fallback
        availability, threaded through so the chain is probed once per
        boundary rather than once per account rotation (review F7).
        ``usage_memo`` is the same walk's per-account report memo, threaded
        for the same reason one level down: the fallback chain may list this
        walk's own provider, whose accounts have already been read.
        ``boundary_sticky_id`` is the credential the session was sticky to
        when the walk BEGAN — the account its prompt cache is warm on — and
        is walk-local for the reason ``preflight_usage`` gives where it reads
        it; the default ``None`` (nothing warm) is only for callers outside a
        walk.

        The binding windows that produced ``health`` can be scoped to a model
        tier while the shared windows still hold quota (Anthropic's
        ``7 day (Fable)`` at 100% beside an 11%-free 5-hour window, when the
        model being routed never draws on Fable). Taking that account out of
        rotation — and, once every account reports the same shape, failing
        over to another provider — strands real shared headroom. Rotation is
        reserved for accounts whose SHARED windows are genuinely binding; a
        tier-only cap keeps the account in service, and the last account with
        any shared headroom — including remaining under the reserve
        threshold — is always allowed to spend it down to zero before
        a provider fallback is even considered. Reserve is a preference
        between siblings of the same provider, not a hop to the next one —
        and, since the provider's prompt cache is per account, a preference
        for NEW picks only: a session already transacting on a reserve
        account stays there (see the ``on_warm_account`` branch), and only a
        depleted verdict moves it.

        A block is a stale verdict the moment a window resets — and preflight
        takes accounts out of rotation on nothing more than crossing a reserve
        threshold, so a pool that still has spendable quota can look exactly
        like a dead one. Each blocked row is probed with its OWN refreshed
        token (asking the cascade would resolve to whichever credential
        outranks the row, and with a healthy unblocked sibling in the pool
        every probe answered for that sibling — re-blocking rows that held
        the only spendable quota). Refresh failures and unknown/unreachable
        reports leave the row's existing block standing and move on. A
        usable verdict (healthy or reserve) in the wave wins over a depleted
        one: the row's block is lifted, the session is pinned to it, and the
        (health, shared, tier, access) tuple goes back to the caller's
        shared policy. A depleted verdict is returned only when the whole
        wave is genuinely out — which is what re-blocks that row and, if
        nothing later recovers, lets the caller hop. ``None`` means every
        blocked account was re-checked and none gave a verdict — only then
        is a provider fallback honest.

        ``attempted_ids`` is the preflight's record of which credentials this
        message boundary has already judged, and it is BOTH read and written
        here. That is what terminates the walk. A depleted verdict sends the
        caller back into ``_apply_account_health``, which re-blocks the row
        and walks the blocked pool again; without recording the probe, the
        row this frame just cleared is blocked again by the next frame and
        re-enumerated by the one after, so two depleted blocked accounts
        ping-pong A→B→A until the recursion limit kills the turn. Every row
        the walk touches is recorded, whatever the outcome: a refresh failure
        or an unreadable report is still a decision taken about that account
        for this boundary, and re-probing it costs a network round trip to
        reach the same answer. Rows are finite and the set only grows, so
        each recursive step strictly shrinks the candidate pool.

        **Probes run concurrently, in bounded waves, but the VERDICT is still
        decided in row order.** The walk used to be strictly serial, which on
        a pool with several blocked rows is a network train (a refresh plus a
        usage GET per row, one after another) on the time-to-usable path, and
        it is what generated the self-inflicted 429 burst whose backoff then
        poisoned the next boot. Three properties keep the concurrent form
        equivalent to the serial one, and each is load-bearing:

        * **Ordering.** ``asyncio.gather`` preserves result order regardless
          of completion order, and the verdict is selected by scanning that
          ordered list. A usable recovery is preferred over a depleted one
          in the same wave (see the scan below); among equals, the first in
          ROW order wins, not whichever probe happened to answer first —
          which is what makes the choice deterministic and reproducible
          rather than a race between siblings.
        * **Attribution.** Each probe reads its own row's refreshed token and
          builds its own ``OAuthAccess``; nothing is shared between probes, so
          running them together cannot cross a verdict onto another row. This
          is the invariant the serial form protected by construction and the
          one whose breakage would take a healthy credential out of rotation.
        * **Termination.** Every row in a launched wave is recorded in
          ``attempted_ids`` BEFORE that wave starts, so the walk's shrinking
          candidate pool is unchanged. Rows in LATER waves are not reserved:
          once a verdict is found, the remaining waves are never launched, and
          reserving them would mark accounts as judged that were never probed
          — retiring, for this whole boundary, credentials nobody ever looked
          at. The serial walk left them untouched for exactly that reason.

        The wave size is capped by
        :data:`SessionStreamFn.USAGE_RECOVERY_PROBE_CONCURRENCY`; see that
        constant for why an unbounded gather is the wrong shape here.

    Resolves the API key through ``auth_store`` (7-step cascade + OAuth
    refresh), picks the wire client from the request's ``ModelSpec``, and

    ``session_id`` rides into the failover layer so the auth store keeps
    credential selection STICKY per session; without it the store round-robins
    on every resolve and multi-credential providers alternate accounts
    mid-conversation (cold cache prefix, alternating identity headers).

    ``cache_lineage_id`` overrides ONLY the provider cache key, defaulting to
    ``session_id``. A ``/fork`` passes its parent's id so the branch keeps the
    warm prefix it inherited byte-for-byte. It is a separate parameter rather
    than a reused ``session_id`` because the two govern different things:
    credential stickiness must stay scoped to the real session (a fork sharing
    a pinned credential row with its parent would be a genuine bug), while the
    cache key is a routing hint whose whole purpose is to follow an identical
    prefix.

    OMITTING ``session_id`` IS ALLOWED BUT COSTS ATTRIBUTION, so it says so out
    loud. Every call this stream function makes is recorded to the shared
    analytics ledger keyed on the session id, and a missing one records under
    the empty string: the spend is counted in the totals but belongs to no
    session, so ``/analytics`` shows an unattributable bucket that reads like a
    broken session. A one-shot probe or a server-side completion with no session
    of its own should pass a stable descriptive id (``"probe-ask-restraint"``)
    rather than nothing. Debug rather than a warning because this is a
    diagnostic about bookkeeping, not a fault the user can act on mid-call.

    The four token counts are DISJOINT buckets: a token counted as a cache read

    own ``input_tokens`` already contains the cached ones, so the caller
    normalizes that before getting here — :func:`cost_for_usage` is the one that
    knows, and is what every caller should use with a live ``Usage``.

    A cache price of ``None`` means the model has no separate cache rate, and the
    tokens fall back to the base input price rather than being priced at zero:
    they were read, so they were billed at something, and free is the one answer
    that is certainly wrong.

    A time-of-use row (``ModelInfo.time_of_use``) is stored at its PEAK list
    rates, so the four rates are multiplied by the schedule's scale for
    ``moment`` — ALL FOUR, after the ``None`` cache fallbacks above, so a token
    charged at the fallback input rate is scaled exactly as the input rate it
    borrowed. A row with no schedule is unaffected at every moment, which is
    every row but DeepSeek's two live ids today.

    ``moment`` defaults to the wall clock, i.e. **the window in force when this
    is called**. That default is a deliberate one: every caller in-tree that
    omits it is a LIVE caller (the status band, subagent rows, the evaluation
    runner) where "now" is exactly right, and a wrong-by-one-window answer is at
    most 2x in either direction. Defaulting to PEAK instead would be

    Getting it wrong is not a rounding error. Charging an OpenAI turn for
    ``input + cache_read`` double-counts the cached prefix at 11x its real rate;
    dropping Anthropic's cache buckets undercounts a warm agent turn by most of

    ``usage`` is duck-typed rather than annotated ``Usage`` because it also

    When ``usage`` carries a provider-reported dollar amount
