"""Credential SHAPES: the scrubber that does not need to be told the secret.

**Why this module exists, and why it is the one place the patterns live.** The
harness already removed credentials it KNOWS about — session credentials and
values registered for scrubbing — by exact byte-for-byte replacement
(:func:`local_operator.variables.VariableStore.redact`). That covers a secret
the session was handed, and it covers nothing else. A remote host's environment
is precisely the set of secrets the harness has never seen: on 2026-09-18 a
subagent ran ``kubectl exec -n backend-services <pod> -- sh -c 'env | grep -iE
...'`` against a production pod and the tool result came back carrying
``MONGO_DSN=mongodb+srv://agent_runtime_model_worker:<pw>@mongodb-prod.…`` in
full. The masking in that pipeline was the AGENT's own ``sed``, its pattern had
no ``DSN``, and the harness had no fallback: nothing on the result path
recognised a credential that was never handed to the session. The value was
then plaintext in a transcript on disk, and a transcript is read by humans,
copied into bug reports and replayed into later model calls.

The response is a SHAPE pass: a pattern table that masks a value because of how
it is SPELLED — a DSN, a connection string, an ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`` line,
a PEM block, an issuer-prefixed token — not because the session knew it. It is
deliberately the same policy the HTTP clients already shipped
(:mod:`local_operator.clients._http`), moved here so there is ONE table rather
than a second copy per surface, and widened to the shapes a real CLI prints.

**STDLIB ONLY, and no imports from the rest of the package.** This module is
imported from :mod:`local_operator.variables`, which is deliberately
stdlib-only and sits on the CLI startup path (see
``tests/unit/test_import_graph.py``). Anything heavier here would tax every
``lop --version`` and every scheduler tick, and a package import would also risk
a cycle through the session layer.

**What this does NOT guarantee, stated plainly rather than implied.** It
recognises a credential that is spelled the way something spells a credential.
It does NOT recognise an opaque value with none of these spellings around it: a
bare tenant id, a session cookie pasted without its header, a high-entropy
fragment quoted in isolation, a secret whose name the table does not know. That
residual is real and is the reason overlap with the exact-value pass matters
(a value the session once saw, or one this pass has already matched and the
store registered, is contained for the rest of the session). There is
deliberately no "looks random" / entropy rule: see the note on
:data:`CREDENTIAL_SHAPES`.

**Two model-visible surfaces this pass does not reach, named rather than
implied.** The composed scrubber is the tool/result seam and everything the
session hands to the loop, which is where the audit that produced this module
looked and where it found the leak. It is NOT on:

* the **system-prompt blocks** (``prompts_api.build_system_blocks``: repo
  guidance, the skills block, the base prompt). A credential sitting in a
  checked-in file that the session injects therefore reaches the model verbatim;
  the session is not the source of that value and cannot contain it;
* the **MCP diagnostics scrubber** (``mcp/redaction.py``), which stays values-only
  by design — the surfaces it protects (``report_failure`` logs, ``explain()``
  text, the TUI notice) are not model-visible, and every model-visible MCP path
  crosses the loop's result hook.

Claiming "every model-visible surface" without those two would be overclaiming,
so this module states the set it covers instead.

**Over-masking is a defect, not headroom.** Every rule below is
context-anchored — a credential has to be spelled the way its issuer spells one
— because the text this runs over is also the text the agent must be able to
read to do its job. A guard that masks every ``*_URL`` or every occurrence of
the word "token" blinds the agent to ordinary output and teaches it to
distrust tool results. ``tests/unit/secrets/test_credential_shapes.py`` pins
both directions: the corpus carries a large NEGATIVE set that must survive
byte-identical, and it is as much a part of the contract as the positive set.


INVARIANT: **a mask is all of the credential or none of it** — never a masked prefix
with the remainder readable. A notice that says a credential was masked has to be
true: a readable fragment left behind has entered the model's context window, which
is the one condition this harness treats as a compromise (see the next paragraph).
`_close_partial_masks` enforces it for every rule, and
`tests/unit/secrets/test_credential_shapes.py` sweeps it over the corpus with a
frozen, ratcheted residual (three rules, each with its reason recorded beside the
table).

**WHAT "COMPROMISED" MEANS HERE, because the severity of the notice hangs off it.**
A credential is compromised when a VALUE reaches the MODEL'S CONTEXT WINDOW — the
unmasked text of a request, the transcript it is journaled to, and so plausibly a
training corpus. A credential that reaches `bash` (its `argv`, a child's
environment), that lives in this process's memory, or that is written to disk in
plaintext is NOT compromised: each of those is a containment, and the only thing it
owes anyone is cleanup. That is why :attr:`ShapeHit.exposed` exists and why it is
the sole input to the escalated notice: only a fragment that survived into the text the
model reads escalates, and a hit that was masked whole is CONTAINED.

**CONTAINED IS SILENT, and the cleanup obligation went with it.** The operator's
instruction is that the contained case files nothing — "as long as something wasn't
actually leaked to the transcript we shouldn't get a session incident indicated
anywhere" — and one consequence belongs here rather than in a diff comment: the
contained wording carried the only cleanup obligation this system ever stated,
*delete any plaintext copy a tool call may have written*, and with contained hits
filed nowhere in-tree there is now no surface that tells an operator a plaintext
copy may be sitting on disk. That is a deliberate trade, not an oversight; the
wording is kept in :func:`~local_operator.incidents.format_shape_incident_message`
for a caller that deliberately has something to say about a contained hit, and
today nothing in-tree does.

This paragraph is about SEVERITY; it changes nothing about
coverage, where under-masking is still a leak and over-masking is still a defect.

#: to end on a value character (plus the assertion at the call site) makes that

#: A value is any run of non-whitespace, bounded, TERMINATED by a delimiter.

#: the wrong direction to bound a match in: the bound belongs in a LENGTH and a
#: terminating delimiter, so the value keeps every character a real credential
#: can contain and still cannot run away into the rest of a document.
_ASSIGNED_VALUE_GROUP = (
    # Greedy run of non-whitespace, whose LAST character must be a value

    # the last-character rule is what makes ``{"password": "abc,defghij"}`` stop
    # before the closing quote instead of swallowing it.
    #
    # There is deliberately NO UPPER BOUND on the value. A bound with a
    # "followed by a delimiter" requirement is a leak for a credential longer
    # than the bound in a whitespace-free run: the engine finds no delimiter

    # IT CROSSES A RENDERED LINE, AND THAT IS THE SAFE DIRECTION. A JSON payload
    # spells every newline inside a string as the two characters ``\\`` and ``n``,
    # and neither of them is whitespace, so a value arriving in a rendering runs
    # past the line break and takes the next line's material with it. Masking that
    # material is an over-mask — it can hide the following line of ordinary code in
    # a notice that stays CONTAINED (``complete=True``, ``exposed=False``) — and the
    # alternative was measured and refused (agent review R1-2, 2026-09-21):
    #
    #   A VALUE THAT STOPS AT THE ESCAPE LOSES CREDENTIAL MATERIAL. Through both
    #   modules in one process: a credential-named assignment whose own bytes carry
    #   an escaped break — a JSON "client_secret" field holding a short run, then
    #   the two characters backslash and ``n``, then forty more characters of
    #   body — is masked WHOLE and contained at ``origin/main``, and with the
    #   exclusion in
    #   place came back with the tail readable while the hit was still graded
    #   ``complete=True``, so the notice claimed a containment that did not happen;
    #   and when the run before the escape was shorter than the seven-character
    #   floor the rule did not fire AT ALL — the value readable, and nothing
    #   registered for containment either, so no later pass could contain it.
    #
    # Under-masking a real credential is the one direction this table refuses to
    # buy with an over-mask, so the value keeps every byte the rendering gave it.

#: The value of an assignment whose value is QUOTED, sharing the grammar above

#:
#: **Why a second value grammar rather than a smarter class in the one above.**
#: The greedy run above is bounded by a LENGTH and a terminating delimiter, and
#: a delimiter is exactly what a quote looks like in compact JSON — so on the
#: surface JSON actually travels on (no whitespace anywhere) the run walked
#: straight through the closing quote and into the NEXT FIELD. Measured on the

#:
#:   \{"access_token":"…","refresh_token":"…"\}
#:

#: mask destroyed the neighbouring KEY (over-masking, the defect the negative
#: corpus exists to prevent) and the grader — correctly, given that match — found
#: a six-character window of the swallowed text inside the unmasked first key and
#: filed a rotation demand for a credential that had been masked whole.
#:
#: The rule added here is the bound the greedy class cannot express: the run stops
#: at the opening quote when that quote is followed by a delimiter or the end,
#: because that is where the value ENDS. It is the last-character rule of the
#: class above, applied recursively to the char that delimits the spelling, and it
#: keeps every case the greedy form handled correctly — `"abc,defghij"`, an
#: escaped quote (`"abc\"def"`) and an inner quote followed by a value
#: character (`"abc"def"`, which is today's behaviour: the value runs to the last
#: quote) all take the same span as before, while the field-crossing match does
#: not exist any more.
#:
#: The unquoted spelling deliberately keeps the grammar above: an unquoted value

#: A credential NAME, in the forms real environments use.

#: This is the part the first version got wrong. The original pattern was a bare

#: environment carries: ```` is ``TOKEN`` preceded by ``_``, and ``_`` is a
#: word character, so there is no word boundary to match. That is exactly the
#: incident that motivated this module — ``MONGO_DSN`` — and the same hole
#: covered ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``, ``DB_PASSWORD``, ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` and
#: ``API_KEY``.
#:
#: The shape is therefore: an identifier-ish prefix made of ``word-`` segments,
#: an optional single leading separator (``_authToken``, ``.netrc``-style names),
#: an optional qualifier, and then the credential word as the LAST segment —
#: anchored at a boundary on BOTH sides so ``monkey`` is not ``key`` and

    would hide numbers the agent needs while protecting nothing.

    **The first segment decides, and then the TAIL decides.** The first-segment
    form is right for the vocabulary above and wrong for the Anthropic usage
    counters the Bedrock cost-tracking work is full of:
    ``ephemeral_5m_input_tokens`` and ``ephemeral_1h_input_tokens`` are counts,
    but their first segment is a MODE, so the tail ``tokens`` won the judgement,
    the counter was masked, and the grader then found a fragment inside the
    swallowed next field and filed a rotation demand for a NUMBER (the operator's
    ``write`` of ``idv-bedrock-ca-pin/EVIDENCE.md``, 2026-09-20).

    The obvious widening — a count word anywhere in the name — is a LEAK, and it
    was measured on the shipped store path before it shipped.
    :func:`is_credential_name` asks only that the TAIL be a credential word, so a
    qualifier that merely CONTAINS a quantity word released real credential names

    ``KAFKA_OUTPUT_SECRET`` (``output``), ``OPENAI_PROMPT_KEY`` (``prompt``),
    ``MY_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`` (``page``) and their relatives — left fully
    readable, with no mask, no label and nothing registered for containment
    (agent review R1-1, QA round 1 Q-1).

    So the sweep is scoped by the TAIL, which is the segment that says what a name
    IS. A tail that is itself a quantity (``tokens``, ``count``) makes the name a
    count whatever qualifies it; ``…_ACCESS_TOKEN`` and ``…_CACHE_PASSWORD`` are
    credentials whatever qualifies them. The first-segment arm is kept exactly as
    ``origin/main`` had it, because it carries the vocabulary the tail cannot: a
    cache HANDLE keys a count, and a model parameter is named for what it limits.

    One residual is knowingly left, and it is pre-existing rather than this rule's:
    a name whose FIRST segment is a count word and whose tail is a credential word
    — the shape where a quantity word opens the name and a credential word closes
    it — is released here, and was released at ``origin/main`` too, because
    ``segments[0]`` is what that arm reads. Closing it means re-deciding the first
    arm (which would re-mask ``cache_key``, the case that arm exists for), not
    widening this sweep, so it is recorded rather than fixed here.

    qualification (``foo::bar::Baz``) and a reference marker (``&``, ``&&``). Both are
    SPELLING, and every guard here that decides a release on what a token is CALLED has
    to read the same part of it.

    **A POSITION, not a SITE, is what this returns — and that is the lesson of the
    fifth round on this clause.** R1-1 was a digit position; R1-2 and R2-1 read the
    ARGUMENT where the fact was the base; R3-1 read the WHOLE BASE where the fact is the
    leaf; R4-1 read the FIRST and LAST segments where the fact is ANY segment. The three
    earlier fixes each widened a read at a call SITE and then enumerated SITES — and
    R4-1 hid INSIDE site 1, one the enumeration marked FIXED, because a site can be
    named correctly while the window it reads is still narrower than the vocabulary it
    refuses. So this returns the whole segment set rather than one leaf: a consumer that
    tests every entry cannot read a narrower window than the vocabulary it refuses, and
    a positional omission is then structurally impossible rather than enumerated away.

    One helper rather than a ``split`` per call site, because the two release-side tests
    in :func:`_is_type_expression` are the SAME extraction
    (:func:`_base_is_a_credential_stem` and :func:`is_credential_name`), and a fix
    applied to one of them and not the other is exactly the miss R3-1 was.

    The token's OWN spelling leads the tuple, so a consumer keeps the whole-string read
    the first-segment test used to provide (``startswith`` on the whole token can only
    see segment 0) while gaining the interior ones.

    Only ``::`` and ``&`` are stripped, and that is the whole REACHABLE set: the
    assigned value's own grammar excludes whitespace, so a lifetime reference can only
    arrive FUSED to the name it qualifies, and a fused lifetime is not separable from
    that name by any split — there is no marker left to cut on. A reference to a
    primitive therefore still reads as that primitive, which is what keeps ``&str``
    released.

    It decides the release on the BASE alone, whatever the argument is (agent
    review R1-2, R2-1). ``Vec<u8>``, ``Map<string, string>`` and ``Arc<Mutex<str>>``
    keep their release because a type's own base is a type name; a base a person
    reaches for when they choose a password — ``Pass``, ``Passphrase``, ``Passkey``,
    ``Passwd``, ``Secret``, ``Token``, ``Auth``, ``Login``, ``ApiKey`` — does not,
    because a passphrase over such a base is a chosen value far more often than it
    is an annotation, and a credential released is worse than a type masked.

    **The test is on the BASE and not the argument, and that is the lesson of two
    review rounds.** R1-2 gated this on a bare primitive argument and so released
    ``Pass<int>``; R2-1 then shipped the same inversion one spelling over and
    released ``Pass<Phrase>``, ``Auth<Token>`` and ``Pass<Vec<u8>>`` whole, with no
    hit. Any later widening of the ARGUMENT grammar must not be able to re-open this
    class, which is what putting the refusal on the base buys.

    **The base is read as EVERY one of its ``::`` segments** (agent reviews R3-1 and
    R4-1), because the discriminating fact is the NAME the token denotes and a
    qualification hides that name behind a path: a qualified spelling whose ANY segment
    is in :data:`_CREDENTIAL_STEMS` is that credential word with a namespace attached,
    and each narrower window released a whole class with NO hit — so the value was not
    even registered for the exact-value pass.

    The windows, and what each one cost, because the series is the point:

    * the WHOLE BASE alone released the qualified class — 360 of 360 combinations of 5
      module prefixes, 12 stem leaves and 6 argument shapes (R3-1), and the
      no-argument spelling (a bare qualified path) released through the
      path-convention branch too;
    * the whole base PLUS its LEAF fixed that and still released a stem in an INTERIOR
      segment — ``foo::Pass::Word``, ``std::Secret::String<Vec<u8>>``, ``&Pass::Word``,
      504 of 504 in the round-4 grid (R4-1) — because ``startswith`` on the whole base
      can only ever match segment 0 and the leaf read takes ``rsplit("::", 1)[-1]``, so
      every segment between the two was invisible to BOTH. That is the whole reason this
      reads an extraction of the full segment set instead: the miss was a POSITION
      inside a call site the R3-1 enumeration had marked fixed, not another site.

    Either test can only ever refuse a release, so widening the window cannot trade
    containment back — which is why every segment is read rather than the two the last
    finding happened to name.

    A stem match is deliberately blunt: it only ever REFUSES a release, so the cost
    of a false hit is a masked type, which is the direction this clause trades in.

def _is_type_expression(value: str) -> bool:
    """Whether a matched value is a TYPE ANNOTATION rather than a credential.

    **Why this exists.** ``api_key: Option<String>`` is a Rust struct field, and
    the assignment rule read the generic type as the value of a credential-shaped
    name: ``api_key`` is a credential name, the type is 14 characters of opaque
    text to the value test, and the name is STRONG, so the value proof returned
    ``False`` and the type was masked. Two of those in one file escalated to a
    rotation demand that stopped a release, which is the cost this exists to
    prevent — a guard that asks an operator to rotate a credential on a type
    annotation is not one anybody can safely learn to ignore.

    **Why the test is a parse and not a shape.** The cheap discriminators — "the
    value contains an angle bracket", "the value does not contain a digit" — are
    both wrong in the dangerous direction: a passphrase is free to contain either,
    and each cheap test releases a whole class of real values with it. So the
    value is read with the grammar real annotations are written in, on the whole
    value, and it is released only when every character of it belongs to that
    grammar: a reference, a path, and balanced generic arguments that are
    themselves types.

    **The named residual, and it is accepted deliberately.** A value spelled
    exactly as ``Ident<Ident>`` — capitals on both sides, no other symbols — is
    read as a type. ``DB_PASSWORD=Pass<Word>`` is therefore released. That is the
    same residual class the neighbouring clauses already carry, and it is bounded
    by construction: no issuer's alphabet contains ``<`` or ``>`` (base64url, hex,
    JWT and UUID all exclude them), every vendor prefix is lowercase, and a
    human-chosen password must additionally be spelled with capitals on BOTH the
    base and the argument and carry **no digit, no symbol and no word break**.
    A credential that meets all of that is not distinguishable from a type by
    spelling at all, so it is recorded here rather than guessed at.

    **The confinement is ENFORCED, not just documented** (agent review R1-1, R1-2).
    Every condition the release is stated to have is a check this function runs,
    because the first implementation documented four and enforced one: a digit on
    either side of the angle brackets, a lowercase base, and a bare ``::`` path each
    released the value WHOLE with NO hit at all. The conditions, in the order they
    are checked:

    * **no symbol** — the ``_TYPE_ALPHABET`` membership test below, and it is
      necessary rather than sufficient: a symbol-less password is confined to the
      alphabet too;
    * **no digit** — :func:`_carries_a_non_primitive_digit`, which allows a digit
      only inside a primitive name, so ``Option<Vec<u8>>`` still parses and
      ``Ident<Ident7>`` does not;
    * **no word break** — the base and every argument must each be a single
      :data:`_TYPE_NAME` token, and the base's own verdict is no longer overwritten
      by the generic that follows it (``foo<Bar>`` is a word, not a type);
    * **no bare path** — a value that is a ``::`` path and NOTHING else is refused,
      so ``Sv::Secret`` is not released; only an attached argument list
      (``collections::HashMap``) is evidence enough.

    A separate release sits underneath this clause and is NOT its doing: a value
    carrying ``[``, ``]``, ``(`` or ``)`` is released earlier by the pre-existing
    expressions clause — ``DB_PASSWORD=x(y)``, ``a[b]`` and ``P@ss(w)0rd`` are
    released identically at base and head — which is the same
    "the type alphabet is not a credential's alphabet" gap and is recorded here
    rather than claimed away.

    What remains released is therefore the digit-free, symbol-free, single-token,
    application-or-bare-name spelling — and nothing wider. The price is taken in the
    safe direction: a digit-carrying type name (``Option<Sha256>``) is now masked,
    which is the false positive this clause *reduces* rather than one it eliminates.

#: The NAME FORM of a vendor tail — the NEGATIVE SPACE of the real one, and the
#: only half of that judgement a regex can spell: lowercase words joined by ``_``
#: or ``-``, optionally with an ``=value`` assignment appended. A real tail is ONE
#: unbroken base64-ish run (the npm and PyPI cases in the corpus carry seven
#: capitals each), while a string made only of lowercase letters and separators is
#: a NAME someone wrote down, and ``docker_compose_build_args``,
#: ``npm_config_update_notifier`` and
#: ``npm_config_manage_package_manager_versions=false`` are all the same thing.
#:
#: **What runs here is that NEGATIVE test, and the distinction is the whole of
#: agent review R1-1.** The positive reading — "a real tail carries mixed case or a
#: digit" — is true only in the direction that such a tail can never be a NAME; as
#: a statement of the predicate it is false, because an issuer tail is a random run
#: that USUALLY carries case or a digit rather than one that must. Only the
#: negative form is what the code enforces, so only the negative form is written
#: down here.
#:
#: **The ``=value`` arm is what the underscore-only rule missed, and the omission
#: was expensive.** An environment variable written in PROSE carries its
#: assignment, so the matched tail is the name AND the value: the old rule
#: fullmatched ``[a-z]+(?:_[a-z]+)+`` against the whole tail, failed on the ``=``,
#: and announced the pair as an npm token. On 2026-09-21 that produced an
#: ESCALATED rotation notice (session ``78e6409f2ba1``, the second firing of this
#: class — the first is the ``--secret NAME`` case on :func:`_flag_value_guard`).
#: The escalation, not the mask, is what made it an incident: the tail is 48
#: characters, ``_FRAGMENT_WINDOW`` is 6, and six-character fragments of an
#: ordinary name (``config``, ``manage``, ``_versi``) are all over the prose
#: around it, so ``_credential_fragments_survive`` graded the mask EXPOSED and the
#: operator was asked to rotate a package-manager toggle. A guard that admits a
#: name does not merely under-mask: it manufactures a false compromise.
#:
#: The two joins are ONE form, not two: ``-`` is the same name spelled the other
#: way (``npm-config-manage-package-manager-versions``), and both spellings are
#: already how every prefix in the table is written. The value half is deliberately
#: character-agnostic (``\S*``) because a value may hold digits, dots and slashes
#: (``npm_config_cache=/Users/…``) — the arm is anchored on the NAME half, which is
#: the half that decides.
#:
#: **The rule's cost is one class of token, and it is accepted deliberately.** A
#: tail that is lowercase words joined by separators is a NAME whatever separator
#: joins it, so an issuer tail spelled that way (``sk-lowercase-words-here``) is
#: left readable, where the underscore-only rule masked the dash-joined spelling of
#: it. Measured against ``origin/main``, 29 of the 42 lowercase-word spellings
#: across both prefix tables change verdict this way — 21 dash-joined, because the
#: old rule knew only underscores, and 8 underscore-joined under the FIXED table,
#: whose own ``_`` defeated its own NAME rule — while 0 tails carrying a digit or an
#: uppercase letter do. That second set is every real issuer token the corpus
#: knows, and no all-lowercase separator-carrying issuer tail has been observed
#: anywhere. The trade is taken because the alternative is the false-positive class
#: above, whose cost is not a missing mask but a manufactured compromise.
#: ``glpat-lowercase-token-value`` in the corpus pins this boundary, so a real
#: token of this shape would break a row rather than pass silently.
#:
#: A run of lowercase letters with NO separator is untouched by any of this: round
#: 1's own repro (``pk-`` plus sixteen letters) still masks.
#:
#: **One residual is recorded rather than closed, and it is narrower still.** The
#: ``\S*`` value arm takes anything after the ``=``, so a credential spelled
#: ``<prefix>-<lowercase words>=<secret>`` survives where the underscore-only rule
#: masked it. Measured: 0 occurrences across 2.6 GB of the fleet's transcripts, and
#: a tail carrying mixed case or a digit cannot reach the form. Closing it needs a
#: predicate on the VALUE half — a wider rule than this fix, with the same
#: false-positive risk on the other side (QA round 1, Q8).
#:
#: **``/`` is a separator here for the same reason ``-`` is, and it was measured.**
#: A path is a name spelled with slashes, and a vendor-looking prefix in front of one
#: is the commonest spelling of a repo slug. Measured 2026-09-21 against
#: ``origin/main``: the prose tail of a docstring in ``local_operator/providers/clients.py``
#: (line 2298) — an issuer prefix, then a lowercase org/repo path — was the one
#: string the pass masked in that whole file, and it is what a ``read`` of the file
#: reported as ``vendor-prefixed-token``, escalating a rotation demand for a
#: docstring mention of a model name on a call that read a source file. The tail
#: after the prefix is a lowercase name joined by a separator; ``/`` was simply
#: missing from the separator class, so the SAME slug survived when its separator
#: was written ``_`` or ``-`` — both already in the class — and masked only in the
#: slash spelling, which is the one a path is actually written with. The cost is the
#: class the two existing separator arms already accept: an issuer tail spelled as
#: all-lowercase words joined by ``/`` is left readable, and a real one would have
#: to be a run carrying no uppercase letter and no digit while containing a slash.
#: ``glpat-lowercase-token-value`` pins that boundary for the same reason.
#:
#: A tail ending in a DIGIT is still a token here (``xai``-prefixed org and repo
#: names that end in a version number included): the charset witnesses a token's
#: alphabet, and dropping the digit discriminator is the change this table already
#: measured and refused (see ``_VENDOR_TAIL``). That residual is recorded, not
#: closed.

    operator-typed key to — ``github token``, ``github-token`` and ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` are
    one entry named ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` — and the spelling ``lop secret run`` exports into a
    child's environment.

    **A ONE-WORD store name is left masked, and that residual is stated rather than

    Two spellings, both of them a NAME: the store's own

    teaches for handing that secret to a child
    under a different name (``--secret NPM_TOKEN=NODE_AUTH_TOKEN``).

    **Why a NAME no longer has to END in a credential word.** The previous predicate
    asked for that, and it is the defect this function no longer has. The judgement
    belongs to the argument's POSITION, not to the name's last word:
    :func:`local_operator.secrets.handlers._run` reads every token after ``--secret``
    as a key in the store (``retrieve_secret(name)`` is the lookup,
    ``environment[variable or name]`` the exported variable), and an operator names a
    store entry after the SYSTEM it belongs to rather than after the credential word —
    ``MINERVA_UI_NPROD_USERNAME`` names an account whose password lives elsewhere. Requiring
    ``PASSWORD``/``TOKEN``/``KEY`` at the tail masked that name in every tool result,
    and the masked text is what an agent copies: the operator authored a publish script
    from the displayed output and the script asked the store for a secret literally
    named ``[redacted]`` (2026-09-22, the reported failure; the guide's own command is
    pinned in the corpus's negative half).

    **The two-part form's right half is a NAME for the same reason.** The flag's grammar
    is ``NAME[=VAR]`` (``secrets/cli.py``'s ``metavar``), so both halves are references
    and neither has to end in a credential word. The halves are judged by the env-name
    SHAPE alone rather than by :func:`_is_a_name_in_the_store_grammar`, because a
    run-together name is the conventional spelling of the CHILD's variable — ``--secret
    OS_PROD2_ADMIN_PASSWORD=PGPASSWORD`` hands the store's entry to a ``pg_dump`` under the one name
    that tool reads.

    **One predicate, two rules** (agent review R1-1). It is factored out because the
    assignment rule sees the same text from inside: ``--secret NPM_TOKEN=NODE_AUTH_TOKEN``
    is also an assignment whose name is ``NPM_TOKEN`` and whose value is the other NAME, and a mask
    there files an ESCALATED rotation demand for the guide's own documentation.
    Whichever rule sees it must reach the same verdict, so they share the clause rather
    than each carrying a copy.

    **What this keeps masked, and the residual it accepts.** A real issuer token after
    the flag (``--secret ghp_…``) carries lower case and stays masked; a value with no
    separator (``--password hunter2xyz``) stays masked; a single run of capitals
    (``--secret DBPASSWORD``) stays masked; and the digit-free lowercase phrase R1-1
    pinned stays masked. The residual is a real credential spelled all-caps and
    underscore-separated (``--token ABC_123_XYZ``-shaped): that spelling IS what a store
    entry looks like and this arm cannot tell the two apart, so it is read as a NAME,
    released, and pinned as a corpus negative carrying that reason rather than left to a
    differential to discover.

    **The two-part residual is WIDER than that one, and it is pinned too** (agent review
    R1-3). Because the halves are read by the env-name shape ALONE, the two-part spelling
    does not need a separator in either half: ``--token ABCDEF=ABCDEF`` was masked before
    this change and is released by it, where the one-part ``--token ABCDEF`` is still
    masked for want of an underscore. That asymmetry is the grammar rather than an
    accident — the left half is a store entry's name, which need not carry a separator
    (``prod`` is a legal entry), and the right half is the child's variable, which
    conventionally does not (``PGPASSWORD``) — so it is stated and pinned as two corpus
    negatives, one with a separator in each half and one with none, instead of being

    OS_PROD2_ADMIN_PASSWORD -- <command>`` is the documented way to hand a stored
    secret to a child, and the token after that flag is the secret's NAME in the
    store — the one thing the operator needs to be able to read. On 2026-09-19 a
    watch-log entry that QUOTED that command set this rule off, which filed a
    rotation ticket in a production transcript for a credential that was not in
    the text at all (the second firing of this class). A value that is spelled as
    an environment variable AND ends in a credential word is a reference to a
    credential, never one — the same judgement this rule already made for the
    ``NAME[=VAR]`` form.

    **The bracket in that form was load-bearing, and it was not honoured.** The
    clause used to test the value as a SINGLE token, so the two-part spelling
    fell straight through it and was masked — the harness's own
    ``guide://credentials`` teaches that spelling as the way to rename a stored
    secret for a child, so following the documentation filed an incident.
    Measured 2026-09-21: a ``read`` of that guide masked the guide's own example
    and filed an ESCALATED rotation demand naming no shape at all.

    **The SEPARATOR is required, and that is the whole of the narrowing.** Capitals
    alone is not enough: it also describes exactly the values this rule exists to catch
    — ``--password PASSWORD``, ``--token TOKEN``, ``--api-key KEY``, ``--api-key
    APIKEY``, ``--secret DBPASSWORD`` — and a first cut that omitted the underscore
    stopped masking all five (agent review R1, reproduced through the session hook: the
    values came back byte-identical with no mask and no notice at all).

    **The credential-word TAIL is no longer required, and that requirement was the
    reported failure.** It masked ``--secret MINERVA_UI_NPROD_USERNAME`` in every tool result — a
    name that ends in the SYSTEM it belongs to rather than in a credential word — and
    the masked text is what an agent then copies: the operator authored a publish script

    An assignment is scrubbed on more than one surface, and one of them is a
    RENDERING: a tool call is journaled as its JSON payload, where every newline
    inside a string arrives as the two characters ``\\`` and ``n``. The name group's
    class is ``[A-Za-z0-9_.\\-]``, so ``n`` is a name character to it, and a name
    that begins immediately after an escaped newline is therefore matched WITH the
    newline's own letter glued on. That is not a cosmetic difference: the count-trap
    exclusion (:func:`is_count_shaped`) keys on the FIRST segment of the name, so a
    count name arrives as itself with a stray ``n`` in front of it, the first
    segment stops being the count word, and the exclusion stops applying to exactly
    the construct it exists for.

    Measured 2026-09-21, and it is why this function exists: a ``write`` of ordinary
    Python source was flagged as carrying a credential, its value graded READABLE,
    and an escalated rotation notice filed for an assignment of a small integer
    constant, the file on disk holding no shape at all.

    **Only an ESCAPE's letters are detached, and only when the backslash is not
    itself escaped** (agent review R1-3, R2-F2). The first revision of this helper
    detached whatever followed a backslash, so a literal backslash before a
    single-segment credential name ate the name's own first letter, the name stopped
    being credential-shaped, and the mask was lost where ``origin/main`` had kept it.
    :data:`_ESCAPE_LETTERS` accepts only the escape spellings above, so a backslash
    that is not one changes nothing.

    The R1-3 answer left the other half of the same reading open, and R2-F2 measured
    it: a rendering writes a LITERAL backslash as TWO of them, so the character
    before the name is still a backslash and ``t`` is an escape letter — the strip
    ate it, ``oken`` is not a credential name, and the mask was gone with no hit and
    nothing registered, so no later exact-value pass could contain it either.
    Measured 2026-09-21: ``"\\\\" + "token=" + <value>`` was masked at
    ``origin/main`` and came back READABLE here. A doubled backslash is the one
    spelling where this reading is DECIDABLE — a backslash with a backslash before it
    is an escaped literal, and the letter after it is the name's own — so it is the
    one spelling where the answer may not be guessed.

    What stays undecidable is stated rather than smoothed over: an UNDOUBLED
    backslash before a name whose first letter is an escape letter IS that escape's
    spelling on the surfaces this pass reads (a tool call's arguments and a tool
    result are both JSON), so the name really does begin after it and the mask is
    correctly absent — the same reading that spares ``C:\\tokens``, where the
    pre-escape grammar masked a path segment. On a surface where such a backslash is
    a literal (a shell word) that is a loss, and it is the residual this helper
    cannot settle from the bytes at hand.

    The letters are read off the NAME rather than off the text before it, because the
    name group starts INSIDE the escape: its first character is the escape's own
    letter, and the backslash is the character before the match.

    An escape's letters belong to the escape, so they are removed before the name is
    judged. The mask does not move: only the VERDICT depends on the name, and for
    every name that is not count-shaped the stripped reading and the matched one

#: own comment: `12` is one unit or two, and every split is a live path). For the
#: pipe's classifiers that ambiguity is bounded by the linear deciders; inside a
#: PATTERN it is a backtracking walk of 2**(digits-1) paths per digit run, and the
#: walk is EXHAUSTED rather than pruned whenever a body line does not parse — so the
#: cost is not a constant factor away, it is unbounded in the input. Measured
#: through the real `_PipeRedactor` (QA round 2, Q3 on #1427): an anchored
#: `"private_key": ` spelling plus a header phrase plus ONE `%8d` row of four-digit
#: columns costs 23 s of CPU at six columns and runs past a 60 s cap at eight, and
#: the 140-row payload that `_release_point` hands this rule once a read exceeds the
#: deferral cap is past 60 s at `bdf3b6cd` (past 45 s at the base revision, so the
#: worst of it is pre-existing rather than this branch's). Nothing is masked in that
#: shape, so the whole cost is pure.
#:
#: WHY IT SPELLS THE SAME LANGUAGE, which is the obligation a second spelling of a
#: language takes on. A split inside a CONTIGUOUS digit run always has an equivalent
#: one-unit parse: the characters between the two chunks are the unit's own `\]`,
#: whitespace and separator, and all three are epsilon exactly when the next
#: character is still a digit — so extending the run by one digit and re-parsing
#: leaves the rest of the line untouched, and by induction every split collapses to
#: the maximal run. What DOES drop strings is a restriction on the unit END (the
#: fragment's comment cites `12 34 MIIEowIBAAKCA`, which needs a unit to end
#: immediately before `34`), and that is a different change. Both directions are
#: enumerated rather than argued:
#: `test_the_digit_maximal_prefix_spells_the_released_fragment_language` sweeps the
#: two fragment languages against each other in both directions, and
#: `test_the_open_rule_matches_its_released_spelling_on_every_fixture` compares the
#: two RULES' matches (start, end, group 1, group 2) over the corpus, the dense
#: payloads and a generated sweep — a divergence either way is a released mask or a
#: published body line, so neither direction may be sampled.
#:
#: SCOPE, and it is deliberately narrow: THIS rule only. `LINE_PREFIX` itself and the
#: three `PEM_*_RE` patterns keep the released spelling, because the pipe's deciders
#: (`_pem_prefix_end_flags`, and the three classifiers built on it) mirror THAT
#: fragment and are pinned against those patterns, while those three patterns are
#: the DEFINITION of their languages rather than a hot path — the deciders decide
#: them. The other two block rules (`pem-private-key`, `gcp-service-account-key`) do
#: not embed the fragment at all, and the fragment alone decides nothing here: it is
#: the ambiguity's combination with this rule's unbounded body run that made the
#: engine walk 2**(digits-1) partitions per digit run.
#: The two units above with every digit run required to be MAXIMAL.
#:
#: The box unit is maximalised only for symmetry with the fragment it mirrors: its run is
#: delimited by `│` on both sides, so it can never be split and the predicate changes
#: nothing it matches.
_PEM_PREFIX_UNIT_MAX = _PEM_PREFIX_UNIT.replace(r"\d+", r"\d+(?!\d)")
_PEM_PREFIX_BOX_UNIT_MAX = _PEM_PREFIX_BOX_UNIT.replace(r"\d+", r"\d+(?!\d)")

#: The `-open` rule's prefix: maximal units, THEN AT MOST ONE RELEASED UNIT — and that
#: trailing unit is what makes this spelling the released LANGUAGE rather than a subset
#: of it (agent review R3-1 on #1427).
#:
#: WHY A UNIT MUST BE ALLOWED TO STOP MID-RUN. `\d+(?!\d)` on EVERY unit is not the same
#: language, because the released grammar lets a unit's tail be epsilon — `\]?`, the
#: whitespace and the separator are all optional — exactly when the next character is
#: still a digit, and the BODY CONTENT may then consume the rest of that run. The witness
#: is a body line of `[` followed by nine `1`s under an anchored header: `origin/main`
#: parses it as the unit `[1` plus the content `11111111` and masks the line (span
#: `(0, 54)`); a fully maximal spelling must eat all nine digits as the unit's run, leaves
#: no eight-character content behind it, and PUBLISHES the line — measured `(0, 43)`, i.e.
#: a released mask lost, which is the one direction this table may never move.
#:
#: WHY EXACTLY ONE, AND WHY LAST. Any split of a CONTIGUOUS run into several units is
#: redundant — collapsing it into one unit does not move where the prefix ENDS — so the
#: only split that can matter is the one that decides where the content begins, and that
#: split is by definition in the LAST unit's run: the released parse's prefix end is
#: either a maximal-run end (those are `*` above) or a position strictly inside the run
#: that the content immediately follows (this trailing unit). Allowing the released unit
#: ONCE, at the END, is therefore the whole difference — and it is what keeps the walk
#: linear: per run the engine has one maximal unit to try, and the trailing unit adds a
#: bounded walk of the FINAL run only, instead of a partition of every run.
#:
#: The full enumeration of both directions is pinned by
#: `test_the_open_rule_restores_the_released_rules_bracket_family` (the witness class and
#: its neighbours, against the independently rebuilt released rule) and by
#: `test_the_open_rule_matches_its_released_spelling_on_every_fixture` (the corpus and a

    # a header here at all. The shape table's ``pem-private-key`` needs a COMPLETE
    # BEGIN … END, so for an unterminated view the pipe's mask is the only layer that can
    # hide the body, and for that spelling it never engaged: measured through the real
    # tool, ``head -n 6`` on a complete CRLF key published 5 of its 25 body lines, and an
    # unterminated CRLF block published 137 body lines on the transcript, 200 in the raw

    # this fix closes it for the ordinary spelling rather than licensing it).
    #
    # The terminator is TOLERATED BY LOOKAHEAD rather than consumed, which is the
    # spelling that covers all three of them: a bare CR line ending (a key file that
    # came off an old Mac, or through a filter that normalised to CR) satisfies ``\r``
    # with nothing after it, where ``\r?$`` could not — the optional CR is backtracked
    # away and ``$`` then has no ``\n`` to sit in front of. Leaving the terminator
    # outside the match is also what the mask wants: its caller hands the bytes after
    # the match to ``_PEM_LINE_BREAK``, which emits the separator verbatim.
    #
    # Widening the TAIL is the whole of the change, and it cannot open a block on text
    # that is not an armour line: the phrase (``BEGIN `` … ``PRIVATE KEY``) and both

# --- the LINEAR decision procedures for the three patterns above -------------
#
# WHY THESE EXIST — and it is the one part of the pipe filter's cost that no
# necessary-condition guard can reach. `LINE_PREFIX` is AMBIGUOUS BY
# CONSTRUCTION: a unit's `\d+` may end in the middle of a digit run (`12` is one
# unit or two, and every split is a live path), so a line with k digit runs
# walks 2**k partitions, and `re` has no memoisation to cut them down. Measured
# on this tree at the classifier call sites in `tools/builtin.py`: ONE
# 65-character `%8d` table row (`%8d`-padded columns — a numpy row, a padded
# column dump) costs 6.7 s in `PEM_BODY_LINE_RE.match` and 3.9 s in
# `PEM_HEADER_LINE_RE.search`; a 3.3 KB read that merely QUOTES a banner costs
# 1.86 s, of which 1814 ms is the body classifier; a 6.5 KB read runs past
# 120 s. `tools/builtin.py` gates what it can, and the gates are what make
# ordinary output free, but they cannot reach this: a read that carries the
# literals OPENS the state, and the body classifier is then asked about lines it
# genuinely MATCHES — `10000000 10000001` is a numbered body line — so no
# cheaper test rejects the pathological line.
#
# WHAT THEY ARE. The same three languages, decided by an explicit mode-set
# simulation of the prefix grammar — the modes are positions in the grammar, one
# character moves the whole set on, and nothing is ever revisited — followed by
# the rigid literal tail each pattern requires, whose candidate offsets are
# ENUMERATED (the tail is at most nine characters, so there are at most a
# handful) instead of searched. Cost is O(len) per call with a small constant,
# for every input shape.
#
# THE EQUIVALENCE OBLIGATION, stated plainly because it is the whole risk of a
# second spelling of a language that was already written once. A divergence has
# two directions and only one of them survives review: a decider that ACCEPTS
# where the pattern does not masks text the agent needed to read (a defect, per
# the module docstring), while a decider that REJECTS where the pattern accepts
# DROPS A BODY LINE — a published key, silently, because the line loop also
# closes the state on it. So the deciders are pinned against the patterns
# THEMSELVES rather than against hand-written expectations:
# `tests/unit/secrets/test_credential_shapes.py` sweeps every character-KIND
# sequence up to a bounded length (these languages are functions of the
# character kind, which is what lets a bounded sweep stand for longer strings,
# and one arm there pins that digit predicate against `\d` over the whole code
# space) and then fuzzes the shapes a caller actually sees. `PEM_BODY_LINE_RE`,
# `PEM_HEADER_LINE_RE` and `PEM_END_LINE_RE` REMAIN THE DEFINITION of the
# language; the functions below are how the hot path decides it.

    `_PEM_ARMOUR_TAIL` (`[ \\t]*(?=\\r|\\n|$)`, read here as its two halves), so a
    CRLF, bare-CR or trailing-whitespace header line matches BOTH the pattern and this

    **The defect this replaces.** The check was ``value in text`` per hit, and
    ``_only_fully_masked`` asks it once per hit, so the pass cost ``hits x bytes``.
    Five session runtimes on this machine were found frozen for 1.5 to 7.2 hours
    with 100% of their event-loop main thread sampled inside the C-level search of
    this pass (``_sre_SRE_Pattern_search`` -> ``sre_search`` -> ``sre_ucs1_match`` /
    ``sre_ucs2_match``) while heartbeats went stale for hours, and one stall dump
    landed exactly here: ``redaction_shapes.py:1963`` in the revision it ran (the
    pre-change line number of ``if value in text``), with ~5.4 G byte-scans for
    0.86 MB of text carrying 6,270 hits. The session
    runtime's heartbeat is an asyncio task on that same loop, so an occupation past
    its 45 s timeout is indistinguishable from a dead runtime and every control call
    refuses without ``--force``.

    **Why 6.4 s of scan is a freeze and not a slowdown.** Cost per byte RISES with
    size, because the hits rise with it: at a fixed hit density the grading half
    measured 1.19 / 1.45 / 1.82 / 2.63 microseconds per byte at 64 / 128 / 256 /
    512 KB. A text big enough to matter is therefore the text this pass cannot
    finish inside a heartbeat — which is the loop occupancy #1363 bounds and this
    change removes.

    **Two questions, both unchanged.** A hit is EXPOSED when the whole VALUE is in
    the text as delivered, or when the value is at least a window long and one of
    its six-character windows is in the text WITH THE MARKER STRIPPED. The
    judgement is the one :func:`_credential_fragments_survive` documents at
    length — anchored on the credential's own characters, the marker never
    material — and this index changes only how the two questions are asked.

    **Each question is asked once for the whole call, over its own keys.** The
    keys are per credential, not per hit, and there are only two of them: the
    distinct VALUES (the whole-value half) and the distinct six-character WINDOWS
    of those values (the partial-mask half). A text with 6270 hits over two
    credentials asks two questions of two keys and 49 windows, and reads the text
    by whichever of the two arms :func:`_searches_are_cheaper` picks — one C-level
    search per key while the keys are few, one gated pass when they are not. That
    is the whole of the change: the text is read a BOUNDED number of times per
    call, and the number of hits does not appear in the cost.

    **The two arms are not interchangeable, and the difference is where the
    marker is read.** The whole-value half reads the text AS DELIVERED, marker
    included, because a credential that is (or contains) the marker survives only
    if its own bytes are in there — the limit pinned by
    ``test_a_marker_inside_the_credentials_own_value_is_a_recorded_limit``, where
    a wholly surviving ``tok[redacted]tail`` must escalate. The window half reads
    it with the marker stripped, because the marker is what a mask WRITES and a run
    straddling one would otherwise match a credential whose own value IS the
    marker (the two ``.npmrc`` spellings and the cookie-header case QA round 1
    found escalating on nothing readable at all). Stripping it also makes the two
    characters either side of a removed marker adjacent, which is what lets a mask
    that stopped inside a credential be seen at all — the case the floor exists
    for.

    **Nothing is built unless a hit needs it, and the ordinary result pays
    nothing.** ``scrub_shapes_with_hits`` returns before this class is constructed
    when the text carries no anchor, and each half is built on its first question,
    so a text whose hits never reach the fragment half never pays for the windows.
    Most results are also far too small for either arm to matter: every text in the
    credential corpus is under 200 characters.

    **What this bounds, and what it does not.** The transient set the previous
    index built (one six-character run per text position, ~100 bytes per byte of
    text, 101.7 MB measured for a 1 MB text) is GONE: both arms are keyed on the
    credentials, so the memory follows the values (~100 bytes per value character)
    rather than the text: those values are substrings of the text, so the length of
    the text remains the bound in the pathological case where every hit is a
    distinct multi-kilobyte value, and the credentials are the bound in the
    ordinary one. The cost that remains is at most ``_PASS_NS_PER_BYTE``
    per byte plus ``_SEARCH_NS_PER_BYTE`` per key per byte, i.e. linear in the text
    with a bound that does not contain the hit count — measured at 0.03-0.21
    microseconds per byte on the shapes that froze a runtime, against 4.3-4.7
    microseconds per byte before, flat as the hit count grows. The memory follows
    the credentials too: on the 1 MB of high-entropy hex text the previous index's
    disclosure was measured against, one credential row now adds **1.0 MB** of peak
    RSS where it added **24.5 MB** (one process per reading, `ru_maxrss` delta
    around a single ``scrub_shapes_with_hits``).

    """Whether this hit is the flag rule's over-mask of an English word.

    **Measured 2026-09-22, on a documentation read.** A ``read`` of a project's
    ``AGENTS.md`` — 33 KB of ordinary prose — escalated to a "rotate it" demand on ONE
    hit: the sentence ``It also accepts --api-key [redacted] you need to override the
    env-backed credential`` puts ``when`` in a credential flag's argument position, the
    flag rule masked that word (deliberately, see
    ``test_prose_after_a_flag_can_match_but_may_never_demand_a_rotation``), and the
    exposure question then answered YES — because a four-character English word occurs
    again somewhere in 33 KB of prose. The rotation demand named the word ``when``.

    **Why the MASK stays and the CLAIM goes.** Masking a word-shaped argument is a
    deliberate over-mask: the cost is one unreadable English word, and the alternative —
    letting a flag whose value really is a short word through — is unrecoverable. The
    ESCALATION was never deliberate, and the module's own test says so in its name: this
    shape "may never demand a rotation".

    **Why the question cannot be answered rather than answered differently.** A value
    that cannot be told from prose cannot be told from prose ANYWHERE in the text: the
    whole-value half of :func:`_credential_fragments_survive` asks whether those letters
    are present, and for a word the answer is yes for reasons that have nothing to do
    with this mask. No amount of reading the text distinguishes the second ``when`` from
    the first, so the claim is REFUSED rather than downgraded — the mask is complete,
    which is what ``complete`` means, and ``exposed`` is the half that cannot be read
    here. The ``vendor-prefixed-token`` arm took the same judgement in the other
    direction (:data:`_VENDOR_TAIL_IS_A_NAME`: there the match is refused); keeping the
    mask and refusing the claim is the protective half of that trade.

    **The class, and the length bound on it.** A bare run of lowercase letters, no
    longer than :data:`_FLAG_PROSE_MAX_CHARS` (four). The bound is the width of the two
    specimens this refusal was written for — the four-character ``when`` above, and the
    three-character word the suite pins — not the module's own masked-value floor it
    first borrowed. :data:`_ASSIGNED_VALUE_MIN_CHARS` (eight) answers a DIFFERENT
    question: whether a short value under a credential-shaped NAME is a placeholder or a
    word. Applied here it read a judgement nobody made, and cost the escalation for
    every five-, six- and seven-character value — the canonical short weak passwords,
    printed twice in the text the model reads, which is the case the survival question
    exists to catch (agent review R1-1). Measured on the 439-row corpus: the grading is
    identical for every bound at or above four, so the wider bound bought nothing.
    Nothing with a digit, a separator, a symbol or any upper-case letter is this class at
    all.

    **The stated limit, narrowed to four characters.** A credential-shaped value of
    three or four lowercase characters that really IS printed a second time in the clear
    is still graded contained, so it files no rotation demand: at that width a word
    cannot be told from a credential ANYWHERE in the text, which is the whole of the
    refusal, and it is the price of not manufacturing a rotation demand for every English
    word that recurs in ordinary prose. It is pinned on BOTH sides of the boundary — the
    four-character ``when`` row in the corpus has to stay contained, and the five-, six-
    and seven-character cases in
    ``test_the_flag_prose_refusal_stops_at_four_characters`` have to escalate again —
    rather than left for a differential to find.

    exposed — the surviving window was the USERNAME — and filed a rotation demand
    for a value that never left the tool. Four corpus hits were affected, three of

    * the marker is not material (the window half reads the text with it stripped,

    * ``complete`` — the mask may be CLAIMED as whole. A truncated PEM is fully

    the two are the same sequence by construction, and the string the matches describe
    is the same one, immutably, because the substitution has not been applied yet.
    ``tests/unit/secrets/test_shape_scan_equivalence.py`` asserts the text AND every

    The mask itself is rendered exactly as ``sub`` rendered it before: a template goes

# section was written for is why that is not enough: an agent that could not
# read a hostname the mask kept replacing printed it REVERSED
# (``moc.avrenimog.aq.ppa-aq``) and the reversal walked straight past the mask.
# The control here is an output FILTER, so transforming the value before
# printing it defeats the filter for exactly as long as the filter knows one
# spelling of it.
#
# The fix is a CLOSED SET OF SPELLINGS per value — the cheap transforms, each
# one deterministic and reversible by inspection — and deliberately not an
# entropy or "looks random" heuristic. See the note on :data:`CREDENTIAL_SHAPES`:
# such a rule cannot tell a credential from a build id, and a mask that eats
# build ids is one the operator learns to distrust.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated rather than implied. This is a spelling list,
# not a decoder. A value put through a transform the list does not enumerate
# (rot13, a double base64, a byte-wise Caesar shift, an escape form nobody
# prints) still passes, and a value SHORTER than the floor below gets its
# permutations skipped entirely. Both residuals have the same shape as the shape
# table's own (see the module docstring): the pass narrows the gap, it does not
# close it.

#: The shortest value whose TRANSFORMED spellings are masked at all.
#:
#: A floor, not a tuning knob, and it comes from the other direction of this
#: same policy: over-masking is a defect. Every family below is a permutation of
#: the value, so the shorter the value, the likelier its permutation is a string
#: ordinary output already contains — the reversal of an eight-character value
#: is a real English word often enough (``atled``/``delta``), and a two-byte hex
#: spelling is a plausible run in any hex dump. Masking those by accident blinds
#: the agent to ordinary tool output, which is the failure this module's
#: negative corpus exists to prevent.
#:
#: 12 is chosen against what a credential LOOKS like rather than against a
#: computed probability: the shortest real API key, session token or password
#: worth registering is far longer. What the floor costs is bounded and

      pairs (``od -An -tx1``'s column layout) and ``xxd``'s DEFAULT 2-byte
      grouping. ``xxd -p`` is the contiguous form above; plain ``xxd`` is not,
      and a dump is a real accident path (``lop secret get X | xxd``);
    * hex behind a backslash escape (``\\x71``, ``\\x7A``), which is what
      ``repr``, ``xxd -p | sed`` and a shell ``printf`` leave behind;
    * percent-encoding, both the path form (``%20``) and the form-value form
      (``+``), each also with its escape digits lowercased (``%2f`` — the two
      cases are the same encoding, and which one a command emits is a librarian
      choice: ``urllib`` uses upper, hand-rolled encoders use lower);
    * JSON string escaping, both the ASCII-escaped form (``\\u00e9``) and the
      raw-Unicode form, the first also with its digits uppercased;
    * the characters of the value spread by one uniform separator.

    bytes — so no contiguous needle spans it; and MIXED-case hex digits inside
    one escape (``\\x71Ab``) are not enumerated, because enumerating them is

class StreamMasker:
    """Mask known VALUES across a stream of chunks, without ever splitting one.

    **Why a window and not a per-chunk pass.** :func:`scrub_values` is a
    WHOLE-TEXT pass, and a stream is not one text. Mask each write independently
    and a value split across two writes is present in NEITHER half — no
    ``replace`` fires in either — so both halves are published and whatever reads
    them as one document has the value back. That is not hypothetical: the eval
    worker emits one frame per ``write``, the parent appends each frame to a
    background job's tail, and ``jobs(op='peek')`` JOINS them back into the one
    string the model reads.

    **The hold is a window and the cut is moved off a spelling.** Only the first
    ``len(pending) - hold`` characters are candidates for publication, where
    ``hold`` is :func:`longest_redaction_form` of the values currently
    registered, and the cut is then moved back to the start of any spelling that
    would straddle it — so a spelling is published whole and masked, or held
    whole, and never in two halves.

    ``hold`` alone is NOT sufficient, and this class does not pretend otherwise:
    a cut is a POSITION, so a spelling that begins before it and ends after it is
    split however much text is held back. The window is what bounds the search
    that moves the cut, and what bounds the buffer: ``pending`` never exceeds
    ``hold`` plus the longest spelling, and both terms come from what the SESSION
    knows rather than from what a caller writes. The bound is
    :data:`_STREAM_HOLD_LIMIT` characters at most, and the residual is the other
    side of it — a value whose longest spelling exceeds the limit is held by the
    limit and no further, so a spelling longer than that can still be split. The
    limit is a bound on the BUFFER, deliberately not a value-length bound, so a
    caller that needs an exact guarantee for one enormous value has to bound its
    own input instead.

    With no values registered the hold is zero and NOTHING is delayed: a stream
    that has touched no secret behaves exactly as it did before this class
    existed, which is the property that keeps it off the latency of ordinary
    output.

    Publication is DELAYED, never lost: ``push(..., final=True)`` releases the
    held tail, and a caller that drops it loses only streamed liveliness, because
    the settled text is scrubbed whole by :func:`scrub_values`.

    Deliberately values-only. The shapes pass is line-anchored and is not
    reachable from every process that streams a value (the eval worker has no
    session store), so a caller that HAS shapes should use the pipe filter in
    ``tools/builtin`` instead — this class is for the surfaces whose whole

        #   ``[^\s]*`` is quadratic in the line's length — the engine retries the
        #   path alternatives at every gap length, and a failing ``[^\s]*\.pem``
        #   walks the rest of the line at each one. Measured on a 140,005-character
        #   single line: 114.4 s of CPU for ONE ``search``, against 0.0009 s here;
        #   on a line of 28,000 verb words, 171.6 s against 0.24 s, so the cost went
        #   from quadratic to linear. Real commands reach 30,849 characters (p99
        #   4.9 KB over 39,111 harvested commands), so the blowup was latent rather
        #   than live — and latent is not safe: the same class of unbounded run had
        #   frozen six sessions on this fleet hours earlier.
        # * SEPARATOR-FREE, because the rule means "a command that READS a
        #   credential file", and the filename has to be an argument OF the verb
        #   for that to be true. ``[^\n]*`` let the two halves sit in different
        #   commands on one line, in a comment, or in a heredoc body — measured
        #   over the same corpus, 47 of the 74 firings were exactly that (``head -30;
        #   echo ---; ls -la .env`` and ``cat /tmp/x); cd ... && cp .env``), i.e.
        #   ordinary reads and unrelated commands nagged about a token they merely
        #   MENTION. ``#`` is in the class for the same reason: a comment is not a

#: Why a second, shorter string rather than the table's ``safer`` text: the
#: notice lands at the END of a result the operator reads through the tool card,
#: which renders one row per line, ellipsised at the row width (92 cells at a
#: 100-column frame) and cropped to the first 40 lines — so the full advice
#: (120-282 cells, measured across all sixteen rules) was unreadable at every
#: width and absent entirely on a long result. A notice the operator cannot read
#: is not a notice. ``test_every_notice_fits_one_narrow_card_row`` pins the
#: budget; ``safer`` keeps the long form for the module documentation.
