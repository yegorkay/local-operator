"""Which previous session ``--resume`` reopens.

A module of its own, and a deliberately tiny one: it imports nothing but
``pathlib``. The CLI has to resolve ``--resume`` before it starts anything (a
typo must be one line on stderr, not a full-screen app that launches, paints and
tears down to report it), and the CLI's startup path is guarded by tests that
FAIL if importing it drags in the engine, the providers, or even ``asyncio``.
Putting this policy in ``session_factory`` — the obvious home — is what broke
that guard: the sentinel alone pulled ``local_operator.harness`` and asyncio onto
every ``local-operator --help``.

Resuming is a filesystem question ("which transcript directory"), so nothing
here needs the engine. ``session_factory`` imports these same functions for the
transcript-directory decision, so the rule has one definition.

#: ``--resume`` with no id. A sentinel rather than a second boolean flag so the
#: whole "which session" decision stays ONE value threaded through one parameter.
RESUME_LATEST = "@latest"

#: Rows the CLI's ``--resume <typo>`` recovery listing prints to stderr.
#:
#: Named rather than a bare ``10`` at the call site because it is a DELIBERATELY
#: short list, not an incidental one: the listing is an error message helping a
#: user who mistyped an id, where the newest few sessions are the help and the
#: whole store would bury it. The picker is the surface that shows everything
#: (:func:`recent_session_rows` returns the full store by default); this is the
#: one place a cap is the right answer, so it says so.
RESUME_RECOVERY_LISTING = 10

#: The file whose presence makes a directory a resumable session. Also what the
#: recency ordering is read from: a directory's own mtime moves for reasons that
#: are not turns (an origin stamp, a sibling file), so it is not the clock to use.
TRANSCRIPT_NAME = "transcript.jsonl"

#: Marks a session directory as machine-started rather than user-started. A
#: subagent's child session is an ephemeral directory under ``sessions/`` with
#: exactly the shape of a real conversation, so nothing on disk told the two
#: apart and the ``/resume`` picker offered every delegated review, design and
#: scout run as if the user had opened it — on one machine 40 of 50 rows.
#:
#: A SIDECAR file rather than a field in the transcript: the picker's whole
#: cost model is one bounded read per row, and a marker inside the JSONL could
#: only be found by parsing it. ``Path.is_file()`` is one stat, and it answers
#: even for a child whose transcript has not been written yet.
ORIGIN_NAME = "origin.json"

#: ``origin`` value for a session a subagent runs. The file is JSON, and the
#: key is a string rather than a bare flag, so a future non-user origin (a
#: scheduled run, a server-side session) is a new value and not a second file.
ORIGIN_SUBAGENT = "subagent"

#: ``origin`` value for a session a command from an agent's shell opened — the
#: escape hatch of :mod:`local_operator.agent_shell`, and (since 2026-09-19) an
#: ALLOWED ``lop exec`` from a session whose role may delegate. The FIRST value
#: minted on the "any non-user origin is hidden" default rather than on a new
#: kind of hidden, which is the point: the operator's sidebar listed two review
#: sessions spawned this way because nothing on disk said a machine had started
#: them. Broadened rather than re-minted when the guard learned to allow the
#: delegating case, because it answers one question — did a command from an
#: agent's shell open this? — and every listing that filters on it wants exactly
#: that answer.
ORIGIN_AGENT_SHELL = "agent-shell"

#: ``origin`` value for a session ``/fork`` branched off another. Unlike
#: :data:`ORIGIN_SUBAGENT` this marks the user's OWN work: the marker records
#: PROVENANCE (which conversation this branched from, in its ``parent`` field),
#: and provenance is not a reason to hide a row.
ORIGIN_FORK = "fork"

#: ``origin`` value for a session an agent's shell opened as a WORKSTREAM: a
#: long-lived parallel run the operator explicitly asked for, which is listed,
#: labelled as agent-opened and steerable rather than hidden.
#:
#: WHY A NEW VALUE RATHER THAN :data:`ORIGIN_AGENT_SHELL`. Both are minted by
#: the same guard and the same call site, so reusing the existing value would
#: have been one line — and it is exactly the wrong line. ``agent-shell``
#: answers ONE question, "did a command from an agent's shell open this?", and
#: every listing filtering on it wants precisely that answer (see that
#: constant's docstring). A workstream is the same provenance with the OPPOSITE
#: disposition: the operator asked for it, so it belongs in the sidebar with
#: attribution. Overloading ``agent-shell`` would make the hidden case
#: UNHIDEABLE — the two populations would share a value, so listing the ones
#: the operator asked for would list every throwaway review run beside them,
#: and hiding those would hide the workstream. One value per ANSWER, and the
#: answer here is "an agent opened this because the operator asked for a
#: parallel workstream".
#:
#: The intent that mints it is carried explicitly (`lop exec --workstream`),
#: never inferred: absent the flag an agent's run is stamped
#: :data:`ORIGIN_AGENT_SHELL` and stays hidden, because that is the default and
#: what every pre-existing caller gets.
ORIGIN_AGENT_WORKSTREAM = "agent-workstream"

#: Origins that are still the user's own conversation, so :func:`is_user_session`
#: keeps listing them.
#:
#: An ALLOW-LIST rather than an ``or`` bolted onto the predicate, because the
#: default for a new origin must stay "not the user's" (see
#: :func:`is_user_session`): visibility is opt-IN, so an author minting a new
#: origin value has to come here and say so deliberately. That is exactly the
#: "has to say so here" the predicate's docstring already demanded — this makes
#: the place to say it a named constant instead of an edit to a boolean.
#:
#: Registering :data:`ORIGIN_AGENT_WORKSTREAM` here is the WHOLE visibility
#: change: every listing in the tree funnels through one scan plus this
#: predicate (the desktop sidebar and the TUI's through ``session.catalog``,
#: ``/resume`` through :func:`recent_session_rows`, the machine-wide desktop
#: feed, the phone's history, ``lop sessions`` and search), so a second place
#: saying "and workstreams too" would be the drift this constant exists to
#: prevent.
USER_ORIGINS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({ORIGIN_FORK, ORIGIN_AGENT_WORKSTREAM})

#: Memoised ``origin.json`` verdicts for :func:`recent_sessions`, keyed on each
#: marker's own ``(mtime, size)``.
#:
#: Why this exists. The listing must READ AND PARSE every marker that exists —
#: existence alone must never be read as "subagent", because a truncated or
#: hand-edited sidecar deliberately parses to ``""`` so it reads as the USER's
#: session rather than vanishing from the picker (see :func:`session_origin`;
#: one such file took the picker down for every session on the machine). The
#: markers that exist are the SUBAGENT ones, and subagents outnumber user
#: sessions ~10.6:1, so that rule costs one file read per subagent directory:
#: measured at 1127 ms over a 31,700-directory store, of which 639 ms is the
#: reads and only 17 ms the parsing. Skipping the read for unmarked directories
#: therefore saves ~8% and cannot fix it; the parse is not the cost.
#:
#: Why memoising is SOUND rather than a guess: the marker is written once, at
#: directory creation (``harness.subagent``), and the only other writer is the
#: one-shot backfill below. The verdict is immutable once written, so a marker
#: whose ``(mtime, size)`` is unchanged cannot have changed its meaning.
#:
#: What may NOT go in here, and why each would be a bug:
#: * Only a verdict actually PARSED from a marker that was READ is stored. A
#:   stat failure or an unreadable file falls through to the real read every
#:   time (:func:`_session_origin_read` reports readability separately for
#:   exactly this): those describe the MOMENT — EMFILE under the descriptor
#:   pressure this scan itself creates, a network volume blip — while the key
#:   is the marker's immutable ``(mtime, size)``, so caching one would serve a
#:   transient outage as a permanent wrong verdict for the life of the file.
#: * A CORRUPT payload is cached, and that is deliberate rather than an
#:   oversight: a parse failure is a fact about the file's CONTENT, stable for
#:   as long as the bytes are, and re-deriving it every scan would return the
#:   same ``""``. Rewriting the marker changes its ``(mtime, size)`` and
#:   expires the entry, which is exactly when the verdict could differ.
#: * ABSENCE is never cached. Unmarked already means user and is the cheap path,
#:   and a directory the backfill stamps later must be re-read, not answered
#:   from a stale "no marker" fact.
#: * A MARKED-BUT-INACTIVE directory IS cached — an abandoned subagent
#:   directory that never wrote a transcript or spool. It was not before the
#:   gate reorder, which reached the activity check first and dropped such a
#:   row (with its cache entry) on the way. This is intended, not a leak: the
#:   set tracks which markers EXIST ON DISK, the verdict is a fact about the
#:   marker rather than about the directory's activity, and retaining it avoids
#:   re-reading those markers on every scan. Boundedness is unaffected — the
#:   file is rewritten to exactly the names seen in the current scan, so a
#:   disposed directory still drops out. Measured impact on the reporting
#:   machine at the time of the change: 0 of 1,986 directories affected
#:   (agent review round 1, R3).
#:
#: Each entry also carries the directory's ``ino``, which is what lets a
#: known-HIDDEN directory be skipped whole — before its marker is stat'd at all
#: — for zero syscalls, and which bounds how long a reused session id can serve
#: a dead directory's verdict. How MUCH it bounds it is filesystem-dependent
#: (APFS reallocates on recreate, ext4 recycles), so :data:`REVALIDATE_EVERY`
#: rather than the inode is the correctness guarantee; see the scan loop in
#: :func:`_scan_sessions` for both measurements.
ORIGIN_CACHE_NAME = "origin-verdicts.json"

#: Bumped when the cache's shape or key changes, so an older file is discarded
#: rather than misread. Independent of ``search_index.INDEX_VERSION`` — the two
#: caches version separately and neither number constrains the other; only the
#: mechanism is borrowed.
#:
#: 2 added the ``ino`` field. An entry without one cannot arm the hidden-skip
#: fast path, so a v1 file would merely be slow rather than wrong — but the
#: loader already discards an unknown version and rebuilds
#: (:func:`_load_origin_cache`), which is the cheaper and more obviously correct
#: migration than teaching the fast path to reason about a missing field.
ORIGIN_CACHE_VERSION = 2

#: How many scans pass between full revalidations of the hidden-skip fast path.
#:
#: **Counted in POLLS, not seconds.** At the sidebar's 2 s interval
#: (``app.py``'s ``set_interval(2.0, self._refresh_sidebar)``) 150 polls is
#: ~5 minutes, which is the ceiling on how long a stale verdict can leave a real
#: session hidden. If the poll rate ever becomes variable, re-express this as
#: elapsed time — a faster poll makes revalidation more frequent (safe, but
#: costlier) while a slower one stretches the staleness window in wall-clock
#: terms without this number changing.
#:
#: Why revalidate at all, given that "once a subagent, always a subagent" holds
#: for every writer in the tree (``harness/subagent.py``, ``fork.py``, and the
#: backfill below, which explicitly refuses to re-stamp an existing marker):
#: because the backfill's refusal exists precisely so that **a marker a human
#: deleted by hand to un-hide a session is not silently written back**. The
#: codebase therefore treats deleting ``origin.json`` as a supported gesture,
#: and a permanent skip would answer that gesture with a session that stays
#: invisible forever. Three independent repairs bound it: this epoch, a cold
#: start (the counter begins at 0, so ``0 % REVALIDATE_EVERY == 0`` and a fresh
#: process always revalidates on its first scan), and the cache being derived
#: data under ``cache/`` that a user may delete at any time.
#:
#: THE COUNTER ADVANCES PER POLL, NOT PER SECOND, so the "~5 minutes" ceiling
#: holds only for a sidebar that is actually polling. A closed sidebar pauses
#: its timer (``_sidebar_timer.pause()``), which freezes the counter: wall-clock
#: staleness is UNBOUNDED while the sidebar is shut, and reopening it does not
#: force a revalidation — the first poll after reopening serves the armed fast
#: path and the epoch resumes from wherever it stopped. A cold start still
#: revalidates, so this is bounded per PROCESS, never per wall-clock. The
#: variable-poll-rate case below is the same hazard in continuous form.
#:
#: One caller opts out of all of this rather than living with the window:
#: ``session.cleanup`` passes ``revalidate=True`` through
#: :func:`recent_sessions`, because its listing is the recent-N deletion guard
#: and a stale row there is an irreversible loss rather than a late redraw
#: (agent review round 1, R2). That forced scan does NOT make a reopened
#: sidebar fresh — it is scoped to the cleanup call and restarts the epoch as a
#: side effect of being a genuine revalidation.
#:
#: Cost of the epoch, measured at 4,000 directories / 50 users. Quote the
#: figure for the surface you mean — these are FULL ``load_catalog`` polls,
#: which is what the sidebar actually pays, and they differ from a bare
#: :func:`_scan_sessions` call by ``load_catalog``'s own per-row work (the
#: scan alone is 151 armed / 4,101 revalidating on the same store, which is
#: what an earlier revision of this comment quoted without saying so):
#:
#: * a fast poll is 266 syscalls, a revalidating one 4,216, so the AMORTISED
#:   figure is 292 against main's 8,166 — a 28.0x reduction.
#: * 292 is the honest number to quote, not 266.
#:
#: Independently reproduced in QA round 1 as 265 / 4,215 / 291.3 / 8,165, and
#: the PR body's table matches; the ~1-syscall spread is where each counter
#: hooks ``os``, not a disagreement. The earlier 151 / 4,101 / 177 / 8,052
#: figures in this comment were the SCAN-only path quoted as if they were the
#: poll — same structure and ratio, wrong surface (QA round 1, Q2).
REVALIDATE_EVERY = 150

#: Scans issued so far, per store, driving :data:`REVALIDATE_EVERY`.
#:
#: Process-local on purpose: it is a POLICY counter, not a fact about the store,
#: and persisting it would let one of the dozen ``lop`` processes on this machine
#: decide another's staleness window — and would cost a write on a path whose
#: whole point is to stop touching the disk. In production this holds exactly one
#: key, the running session's config dir. Keyed by path string rather than
#: ``Path`` so a test's ``tmp_path`` cannot collide with a live store.
_SCAN_COUNT: dict[str, int] = {}

#: Journals the session's title (and every name it has ever borne) beside the
#: transcript, mirroring :data:`ORIGIN_NAME` exactly. A SIDECAR rather than a
#: field in the JSONL for the same reason the origin marker is one: the picker's
#: cost model is one bounded read per row, and the title in force can sit
#: anywhere in a multi-megabyte transcript (the auto-name lands at turn 2, a
#: mid-session ``/rename`` lands in the untouched middle — see
#: :data:`TITLE_SCAN_BYTES` for the window-scan gap this closes). ``Path.stat``
#: plus a sub-kilobyte read is O(1) in transcript size where the scan is not,
#: so :func:`stored_session_title` consults this first and only falls back to
#: the window scan for sessions written before the sidecar existed.
TITLE_SIDECAR_NAME = "title.json"

#: The title backfill's per-directory "nothing to journal" marker. The sweep
#: used to treat only an existing :data:`TITLE_SIDECAR_NAME` as answered, so a
#: session with no journalled title anywhere in its transcript — the majority
#: of a long-lived store, since every session that simply never got renamed
#: stays in that state forever — was FULLY RE-READ on every boot: measured 323
#: ms per boot on a 1,365-session store, 1,268 of which could never produce a
#: sidecar. The sentinel records that the scan RAN and found nothing, so the
#: second boot's answer costs one ``stat`` per directory. JSON rather than an
#: empty file so a future reader can carry a reason (``scanned_at``) without a
#: second format migration; ``write_session_title``'s mtime-preservation
#: contract applies to it too, for the reason its docstring gives.
TITLE_SCAN_SENTINEL_NAME = "title-scan.json"

#: The origin sweep's own "considered and not a subagent" marker, mirroring
#: :data:`TITLE_SCAN_SENTINEL_NAME`. It exists SEPARATELY from that sentinel
#: because the two sweeps answer different questions and traverse
#: independently: the origin sweep stops at ``limit`` STAMPS while the title
#: sweep is uncapped, so a title sentinel must never stand in for an origin
#: answer — a directory the origin sweep never reached would be suppressed
#: forever. Only the origin sweep writes this file, so its presence means
#: exactly "this pass read this opener and it was not a subagent's".
ORIGIN_SCAN_SENTINEL_NAME = "origin-scan.json"

#: The session's ATTACHED IDENTITY — the ``/team`` roster, the ``/agent``
#: profile, and the ``/goal`` — journalled beside the transcript, mirroring
#: :data:`TITLE_SIDECAR_NAME` exactly.
#:
#: Why this file has to exist at all: the team and agent briefs ride the
#: VOLATILE TAIL of the system prompt (see ``prompts_api.build_system_blocks``
#: and ``session/goal.py``), and the tail is rebuilt from a ``GoalState`` that
#: ``session_factory`` constructs EMPTY on every session. Nothing in the
#: transcript reproduces it, so a ``--resume`` genuinely dropped the persona
#: from the prompt — the manager a user attached with ``/team`` was not merely
#: missing from the status band, it was gone from the model's instructions and
#: the conversation carried on as an ordinary session. Only the FRONT END could
#: see the blank band, which is why this read as a display bug for so long.
#:
#: A SIDECAR rather than a transcript row, for the reasons the title sidecar
#: documents and one more that is specific to this state: the attachment is a
#: property OF the session, not an event IN the conversation, and the restore
#: runs during construction, before any replay, so a value it had to scan the
#: JSONL for would arrive too late to reach the first prompt's tail.
ATTACHMENT_SIDECAR_NAME = "attachment.json"

#: The judged-goal record's own sidecar, beside the attachment rather than
#: inside it (see :func:`write_goal_record`). New in the judged-goal feature:
#: older builds neither read nor write it, which is what lets a record survive a
#: downgrade round trip.
GOAL_SIDECAR_NAME = "goal.json"

#: The two openings only the subagent runner can produce, used ONLY by the
#: one-time backfill for directories that predate the marker.
#:
#: ``[role: <name>]`` is built by ``AgentProfile.preamble`` and ``[scout mode:``
#: is a literal constant in the subagent module; both are stamped in FRONT of
#: the caller's prompt, so they can only appear at offset 0 of a child's first
#: user message. Anchored and exact for that reason: the cost of a false
#: positive is hiding one of the user's own conversations, which is the very
#: failure the absence-means-user default exists to avoid, so these match what
#: the machine writes and nothing that merely resembles it.
_ROLE_PREAMBLE = re.compile(r"\[role: [a-z0-9_-]+\]\n")
_SCOUT_PREAMBLE = "[scout mode:"

#: How much of the opening message a session name may keep. Long enough to tell
#: two days' work apart, short enough that a column of them still scans.
NAME_MAX_CHARS = 64

#: The custom-entry type a session journals its title under. Spelled here as
#: well as in ``session/naming.py`` because this module may not import the
#: engine (see the module docstring — the CLI's startup guard fails if it
#: does), and :func:`stored_session_title` scans the raw JSONL rather than
#: replaying it. ``test_the_journalled_title_type_matches_the_writer`` pins the
#: two spellings together, so a rename breaks a test instead of silently
#: returning every session to its opening message.
_TITLE_CUSTOM_TYPE = "conversation_name"

#: Bytes of the transcript the stored-title scan reads at EACH END. Both ends,
#: because the two facts about a title pull in opposite directions:
#:
#: * The title in force is the NEWEST one — a rename appends a fresh row rather
#:   than rewriting the old one — so a rename made an hour into a long session
#:   is only findable near the tail.
#: * The FIRST title is journalled when the session is auto-named, at turn 2,
#:   which is near the head and is pushed further from the tail by every turn
#:   that follows.
#:
#: A tail-only scan therefore missed the title on most real sessions: measured
#: on this store, 145 of 187 transcripts (78%) are larger than this window, so
#: a session named at turn 2 and then worked in for an hour silently reverted
#: to being labelled by its opening message — the exact failure this function
#: exists to fix, and the long sessions it hit hardest are the ones a user is
#: most likely to be hunting for a week later.
#:
#: Reading both ends rather than the whole file is what keeps the cost per
#: picker row bounded on a 6 MB transcript.
#:
#: **The window gap this scan cannot close, and where it is closed instead.**
#: A rename made mid-conversation, then buried under a further 128 KB and never
#: renamed again, falls between the two windows: the head still holds the
#: ORIGINAL title, so a window-only scan labels that session with the name it
#: was renamed *away from*. Worse, a topic-pivot session auto-named late (its
#: only titles sitting in the untouched middle of a multi-megabyte transcript)
#: is invisible to both windows and reverts to its opening message — the
#: reported failure of a session that could not be found by its own subject.
#:
#: This scan does not try to fix that by widening: reading whole transcripts on
#: the picker's synchronous path was measured at 400 ms against 64 ms across a
#: real store. Instead the fix the previous comment here PRESCRIBED is now
#: implemented — the title is journalled to a sidecar (``title.json``, see
#: :func:`write_session_title`) the way :func:`mark_session_origin` journals
#: origin, one stat and one small read with no size dependence at all.
#: :func:`stored_session_title` consults that sidecar first, so this window
#: scan is now the FALLBACK for sessions written before the sidecar existed and
#: not yet reached by :func:`backfill_session_titles`, not the primary path.
#: Both ends are still read because that fallback still wants the newest title
#: it can reach on a pre-sidecar session.
TITLE_SCAN_BYTES = 131_072

#: Matches a journalled title row in raw JSONL, tolerant of whitespace after
#: the colons for the same reason :data:`_FRAGMENT_USER_RE` is: the session
#: writer emits compact JSON, but a transcript written by a fixture or a future
#: exporter is the same document. ``(?:[^"\\]|\\.)*`` steps over escaped quotes
#: so a title containing one is not cut at it.
_TITLE_ROW_RE = re.compile(
    r'"custom_type"\s*:\s*"' + _TITLE_CUSTOM_TYPE + r'".*?"text"\s*:\s*"((?:[^"\\]|\\.)*)"'

#: Characters of a transcript the name scan will read before giving up — not
#: bytes: the file is opened in text mode, so this bounds the decoded string,
#: which is what actually occupies memory here. A name is a convenience; a
#: pathological first line (a pasted file, a base64 image) must not turn
#: opening the picker into reading megabytes off disk for every row.
NAME_SCAN_CHARS = 64_000

#: How far into a half-read first line the scan will look for the marker that
#: says the fragment is a user message. The writer emits ``id``/``ts``/``type``
#: before the payload, so the role sits ~110 characters in; a few hundred is
#: slack for a longer id without letting the marker match something deep in a
#: pasted body.
_FRAGMENT_HEAD_CHARS = 400

#: BYTES of a transcript's tail read when previewing its last reply.
#:
#: Bytes, not characters, because this seeks from the END of the file, and a
#: byte offset is the only thing ``seek`` accepts. The window is decoded with
#: ``errors="replace"`` and its first (probably partial) line dropped, so
#: landing mid-codepoint is harmless.
#:
#: Sized for the same reason :data:`NAME_SCAN_CHARS` is: the preview is a
#: convenience shown on a list row, and one pathological entry — a pasted file,
#: a base64 image — must not turn painting that list into reading megabytes per
#: session. 64 KiB comfortably holds the last several entries of an ordinary
#: transcript while bounding the pathological one.
PREVIEW_SCAN_BYTES = 64_000

#: Characters of the previewed reply kept. A list row shows one line; anything
#: past this is cut by the surface anyway, and carrying more over the wire for
#: every row in the list is pure weight.
PREVIEW_MAX_CHARS = 200

#: ``harness.message_types.SESSION_INCIDENT_MESSAGE_TYPE``, spelled out rather
#: than imported. This module's contract (see the module docstring, and
#: ``tests/unit/test_import_graph.py``) is that importing it drags in nothing —
#: not the engine, not the providers, not ``asyncio`` — because it is on the
#: path of ``local-operator --help`` and of every picker row. The vocabulary
#: module is a cheap module today, but the guard is about the GRAPH, not about
#: today's cost, and a literal keeps this module's import list empty.
#:
#: The duplication is pinned by a test that imports both and asserts they are
#: equal, so a rename cannot silently turn this scan into one that matches
#: nothing (which would degrade to the house sentence and look like "this
#: session had no failure" rather than like a bug).
_SESSION_INCIDENT_TYPE = "session_incident"

#: The marker that says a fragment is a user message, and the first COMPLETE
#: JSON string value of a ``text`` key. Both tolerate whitespace around the
#: colon: the session writer emits compact JSON, but a transcript written by
#: anything else (a test fixture, a hand-edited file, a future exporter) is
#: still the same document, and a scan that only matched the compact spelling
#: silently returned no name for it.
#:
#: The closing quote is what makes the text value complete: a value still

#: ``title.json``'s stat key -> the value that file parsed to, ``None`` included.
#:
#: WHY A MEMO AT ALL. ``title.json`` is read once per row by two surfaces that
#: answer the same question about the same rows in the same process — the
#: sidebar's catalogue poll and the ``/resume`` picker — and TWICE for one row
#: inside a single catalogue build, because a fork's mark asks for the sidecar
#: that ``session_name`` has just read. Each read is an open, a read and a JSON
#: parse for a sub-kilobyte document whose answer only changes when the file
#: does; measured on the n=200 ladder, the memo turns the second surface's 200
#: reads into 200 stats (``session/retention.py``'s "one stat instead of a read"
#: trade, which is the same one ``catalog._BIRTH_MEMO`` makes).
#:
#: THE KEY IS THE FILE'S OWN STAT — inode, device, size, nanosecond mtime AND
#: nanosecond ctime — taken by the lookup, never a time window and never the
#: session directory's mtime (a directory mtime moves when ANY entry is added,
#: so keying on it would serve a stale title after a rename and re-read after an
#: unrelated write; the failure it must not have is the first one). Every writer
#: that matters moves at least one component:
#:
#: * ``write_session_title`` publishes a fresh temp file with ``os.replace``, so
#:   every rewrite is a NEW INODE (the same argument ``_BIRTH_MEMO`` makes);
#: * a hand edit or a repair changes size and both timestamps;
#: * a deleted-and-recreated directory gets a new inode; a renamed one is a
#:   different session id and so a different file.
#:
#: ``ctime_ns`` is what makes this key STRONGER than the two memos beside it:
#: ctime is updated by any inode change (write, chmod, link) and cannot be set
#: from userland, so the ``touch -r`` blind spot ``_BIRTH_MEMO`` documents as
#: accepted does not exist here. The remaining blind spot is a rewrite landing in
#: the SAME NANOSECOND as the original with the same inode, size and mtime — a
#: same-nanosecond in-place rewrite, which no writer in this codebase performs.
#:
#: A MISS costs one stat more than the bare read did (the lookup), which is why
#: this is worth having only for sidecars that are read more than once; see the
#: measured split in the lane's census. A HIT costs one stat instead of an open
#: plus a read plus a parse.

    anyone would choose deliberately.

    WHERE THE DIRECTORY LIST COMES FROM, and why that is the whole of this
    lane's change here. It used to be ``sorted(sessions.iterdir())``: every
    directory in the store, each paying ``transcript.is_file()``,
    ``origin.json.exists()`` and the sentinel's ``exists()`` before the sweep
    could conclude it had nothing to say. On a store of the reporting machine's
    shape that is ~11.5k directories and ~17.6k syscalls for a pass that stamps
    nothing, re-paid every host minute by every runtime's maintenance thread.

    :func:`_scan_sessions` already answers the two questions that decide whether
    a directory can possibly be a candidate — "does it have a transcript" and
    "does it carry an origin marker" — for the whole store, and it answers the
    dominant one for FREE: a directory the verdict cache knows is hidden is
    skipped whole from the ``readdir`` batch, so the ~93% of a real store that
    is delegated runs costs this pass zero syscalls. What is left is the user's
    own sessions, which is the population the sweep is actually about, and the
    directories that are neither listed nor cached-hidden (never active, no
    marker) drop out too — the old walk paid a stat for each of them.

    The candidate set is therefore ``rows`` with an empty ``origin`` (a readable
    marker means the question is already answered), taken in NAME order because
    that order is what decides WHICH directories a run bounded by ``limit``
    answers — see the paragraph above. The three existence checks are still made
    against the filesystem rather than carried out of the projection, and one of
    them is load-bearing: a row with ``origin == ""`` is either a directory with
    NO marker or one whose marker exists but would not parse, and the second
    must be skipped exactly as before (a corrupt marker deliberately reads as
    the user's own session, so re-stamping it would hide a row the fail-safe
    keeps visible). The projection cannot tell those apart, and one stat per
    USER session is a cheap way not to widen the scan's return shape — which
    every other caller unpacks — for it.

#: How old a directory must be, relative to the title sweep's frontier, before
#: the frontier is trusted to answer for it.
#:
#: A GUARD BAND, not a tuning knob. The frontier is a wall-clock instant and a
#: directory's ``st_mtime_ns`` is a filesystem timestamp, and the two can
#: disagree in the direction that loses a sweep: a filesystem with one-second
#: granularity (some ext4 mounts) reports an mtime truncated DOWNWARD, so a
#: directory created just after the pass started could carry a stamp below it —
#: and would then be treated as answered when nothing had looked at it. Two
#: seconds covers that granularity plus ordinary clock skew; the cost is that
#: directories touched in the two seconds before a pass are re-probed, which on
#: a store of any size is a handful of stats.
TITLE_SWEEP_GUARD_NS = 2_000_000_000

#: ``cache/`` record of how far the title sweep has verified the store.
#:
#: WHY A SECOND KIND OF CACHE IS NEEDED HERE, and why the scan's projection
#: cannot do this job. ``_scan_sessions`` answers "does this directory carry an
#: origin marker" — which is the whole of the origin sweep's question — but the
#: title sweep's question is different in kind: "has this directory already been
#: answered for titles?", whose answer lives in the per-directory sidecar or
#: sentinel this sweep writes. Carrying THAT in the projection would mean
#: stat-ing two more names per directory inside the 2-second catalogue poll,
#: which is exactly the per-hidden-directory cost the poll exists not to pay; so
#: the title sweep gets a store-level record of its own instead.
#:
#: WHAT IT RECORDS: the wall-clock instant a pass STARTED, and only for a pass
#: that ran to completion over the whole store (see the sweep for the three ways
#: a pass is incomplete). A directory is then answered without being looked at
#: when its own mtime is older than that instant.
#:
#: WHY THAT IS SOUND, in both directions. A completed pass ANSWERS every
#: directory that has a transcript: it writes a sidecar when it finds a
#: journalled title and a sentinel when it finds none, and those are the only
#: two outcomes for such a directory. A directory it skipped had no transcript
#: at that instant, and a transcript appearing later CREATES AN ENTRY in the
#: directory, which moves the directory's own mtime — the thing this check
#: reads. In the other direction, the only way a directory becomes un-answered
#: is the removal of its sidecar and sentinel, which is also an entry removal
#: and therefore also moves that mtime. So "older than the frontier" and
#: "answered" cannot come apart without something moving the mtime, which is
#: what makes this a cache of the sentinels rather than a second source of truth
#: beside them: the sentinels are still written, still read by nothing else, and
#: still the durable per-directory record.
#:
#: WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, stated rather than elided: a directory whose mtime is
#: moved BACKWARDS below the frontier (a restore that preserves timestamps while
#: omitting the answer files) is not re-probed. That is the same class of
#: accepted staleness ``ORIGIN_CACHE_NAME`` documents for a hand-deleted marker,
#: and the same remedy applies — this file is derived data under ``cache/``, so
#: deleting it forces the full pass.
TITLE_SWEEP_STAMP_NAME = "title-sweep.json"

#: Bumped when the stamp's shape changes, so an older file is discarded rather
#: than misread. Same mechanism as :data:`ORIGIN_CACHE_VERSION`.

    Mirrors :func:`backfill_session_origins` exactly, and for the same reason:
    without it the sidecar fix only applies to sessions renamed AFTER the
    upgrade, so the person who reported being unable to find a topic-pivot
    session by its subject would upgrade, look, and see the same unfindable row
    — the change would be correct and appear to do nothing until each session's
    next rename. This one-time sweep makes every existing session findable by
    every name it has borne immediately after upgrade.

    A session with a title in the untouched middle of a large transcript is the
    case this exists for: :func:`stored_session_title`'s window scan misses it,
    so a full read (:func:`_scan_all_titles`) is the only way to recover its
    real title and its past names. That read is O(transcript size), which is why
    it is confined to this startup path — bounded by ``limit`` and run once per
    session ever, never per picker-open — exactly the trade
    :func:`backfill_session_origins` makes.

    "Once per session ever" now includes the no-title case. A directory with
    no journalled title gets a sentinel (:data:`TITLE_SCAN_SENTINEL_NAME`) so
    the next boot answers it with one ``stat`` instead of another full read;
    without it the sweep was perpetual on exactly the store it was meant to
    fix once — a session that never bore a title can never grow a sidecar, so
    it was re-scanned to the same "nothing" on every launch for the store's
    whole life (measured 323 ms per boot on a real 1,365-session store,
    1,268 of them permanently in that state). The sentinel is deliberately
    NOT a title: neither the picker nor :func:`stored_session_title` reads it,
    so their behaviour is byte-identical before and after.

    Best-effort and bounded like every other function here: an unreadable
    directory is skipped rather than raised, and ``limit`` caps how many
    sidecars are WRITTEN per run.

    The cap is on work done, never on how far the scan reaches, for the reason
    :func:`backfill_session_origins` documents at length: slicing the directory
    list instead would leave any session sorting past the cut unvisited on
    every run forever, because the list sorts by hex name and the same prefix
    is recomputed each startup.

    THE FRONTIER, which is this sweep's half of the lane. On the reporting
    machine this pass cost 318.8 ms CPU per cycle for a store whose answers had
    all been written long ago: every directory paid ``transcript.is_file()``,
    ``title.json.exists()`` and ``title-scan.json.exists()``, forever, to
    re-confirm a fact that only changes when the directory's CONTENTS change.
    :data:`TITLE_SWEEP_STAMP_NAME` records how far a COMPLETED pass has verified
    the store, so a directory older than that frontier is answered by ONE stat
    against the directory itself. The reasoning that makes that equivalent — and
    the one shape it does not cover — is on the constant.

    A pass advances the frontier only when it is COMPLETE, and there are four
    ways it is not: ``limit`` cut the work short, a directory could not be
    stat-ed, an answer could not be WRITTEN (a store that has gone read-only
    must not be recorded as swept, or the next writable pass would never
    revisit it), or the process left mid-pass. An incomplete pass leaves the old
    frontier exactly where it was, so the next one re-runs the same window
    rather than declaring it done — the same direction
    ``analytics.backfill``'s rollup frontier takes when a day fails.

    Cost, stated rather than elided: the FIRST pass after this change, and the
    first pass on a store whose frontier has been deleted, pays what the old
    walk paid (measured 196.6-225.4 ms CPU against the old sweep's 268.7 ms on
    the fixture, the difference being the answer check moved in front of the
    transcript stat). Every pass after it costs one stat per directory plus one
    ~60-byte atomic write of the frontier itself — measured 45.1 ms CPU and
    11,548 syscalls for 11,546 directories, against 268.7 ms and 22,815.

    The stamp is the pass's own START, read before the first directory: a
    session created while the pass is walking must be re-probed by the next one,
    and a stamp taken at the END would claim it. A stamp from the FUTURE (the
    clock stepped backwards since it was written) is discarded rather than
    trusted, because every directory created in the interval would carry an
    mtime below it; a forward step merely costs a pass that re-probes more.

    ``@latest`` used to answer this with a private ``sessions.glob("*")`` walk —
    two ``stat`` calls and an ``origin.json`` READ per directory, re-done on
    every ``lop --resume`` — while :func:`_scan_sessions` (the picker's own scan,
    which the origin-verdict cache and the known-hidden skip already make cheap)
    answers the same question from the same rule. Measured against a fixture
    built to the real store's own census (11,546 directories, 93% of them
    delegated runs): **690.8 -> 45.4 ms CPU**, and **23,093 -> 887 syscalls**
    (one ``scandir`` plus one marker stat per USER session, zero for the hidden
    population).

    This is not a second ranking. The ranking IS ``_scan_sessions``'s: rows come
    back sorted by ``(-activity, name)``, so ``rows[0]`` is the same element
    ``max`` computed over ``(activity, _reverse_name(name))`` — newest first,
    ascending id on a tie — and there is exactly one place that decides it.

    Identity, spelled out because this picks WHICH conversation reopens and a
    wrong-but-plausible answer is a data bug the caller cannot see:

    * ``include_archived=True``. The glob never consulted the archive index, so
      an archived session has always been eligible HERE even though the picker
      does not DRAW it. The scan's default would have silently changed which
      session ``@latest`` opens on a store whose newest session is archived,
      which this change is not allowed to do; the picker/``@latest`` mismatch is
      pre-existing and left exactly as it was.
    * The candidate rule is the scan's own, not a parallel one: activity is
      ``session.retention.session_activity_path`` (:func:`session_activity` is
      the same body taking a ``Path``, so it is the same clock and the same
      answer), and visibility is :func:`_is_hidden_origin` — the documented
      negation of :func:`is_user_session`'s rule, sharing ``USER_ORIGINS``.
    * The one real difference is the ORIGIN VERDICT CACHE, and it is the window
      the 2-second poll already accepts: a marker DELETED by hand keeps its
      cached verdict until :data:`REVALIDATE_EVERY` (and a cold start always
      revalidates), where the glob re-read the file every time. The direction is
      safe — the cached verdict was itself parsed off a marker that existed, so
      the directory stays hidden exactly as the backfill intended. A NEW marker
      is never served from that cache (absence is deliberately not memoised), so
      a delegated run that started since the last scan is hidden on this very
      resolution.
    * A store that cannot be walked answers "nothing to resume"
      (:class:`ResumeNotFound`) rather than raising, which is what the
      explicit-id path below already promises for the same condition.

    The cost model, because "one scandir + one stat per user session" is the
    claim this function is measured by: the scan iterates the store with
    ``scandir`` (free — no per-entry stat for a directory it already knows is
    hidden, which is what makes the bulk of a real store cost zero syscalls) and
    must stat each user-visible directory's ``origin.json`` to re-validate the
    verdict it cannot memoise for an UNMARKED directory; those stats are the
    invalidation check and nothing else is issued.

    Two writers on one transcript is how a TUI ``/resume`` of a phone-started
    session painted the splash: the second process claimed the directory,
    replayed a mid-write journal, and left the first process as the only one
    still appending. The live process already publishes to the phone, so a
    second front end should attach to THAT process rather than open another
    writer.

    Consults the session directory's ``.session.pid`` liveness marker — the
    same file the retention sweep uses. Stdlib-only and import-light: this
    module must stay off the engine and the mobile package (see the module
    docstring); the shared probe it uses is the stdlib-only leaf module
    :mod:`local_operator.procstate`, which is not part of either. A live TUI or
    phone-started child always writes that marker when it claims the directory.

    **A zombie is not an owner.** Signal 0 succeeds against an exited-but-
    unreaped process, and this marker is written by the runtime that owns the
    session — whose parent is often a long-lived TUI that may never reap it.
    Reporting such a pid as the owner is what turned a killed runtime's session
    into one that no interface would open: every attach path here refused with
    "session X is already open in another process (pid N)", naming a corpse,
    while the lease that decision agrees with kept the claim out of reach of
    the one mechanism that recovers it. Discovery, the attach guard and the
    lease all learn the same answer from one probe now; see
    :func:`local_operator.procstate.is_zombie`.

    ``check_zombie=False`` is for the engage loop's DISCOVERY path, which calls
    this on every pass of its dense 10 ms grid: the proof costs a `ps` fork
    (2.4-4.6 ms measured across runs on this host), which is more than the dead
    time that grid exists to remove. At the three user-facing call sites (the
    TUI's ``/resume``, ``lop exec --resume`` and the phone's attach) the answer
    IS the decision, so they keep the default.

    Cheap mode is not merely a wait, and saying so would be wrong. It cannot
    change ARBITRATION — the loop's decision to attach or spawn still ends in a
    runtime that has to acquire the lease, and that path always demands the proof
    — but its answer is also read by ``find_runtime_record`` to SELECT a record,
    and the two errands that deliver nothing (``WarmErrand``, ``WakeErrand``)
    treat reaching a live record as the completed errand. So on the one pass
    where an owner published AND died between two dense polls, the cheap answer
    can hand back a corpse's record and report that errand ready. The window is a
    single dense pass (~10-25 ms) because any pass that sees a record ends the
    grid, the next pass proves the owner dead, and a wake is retried rather than
    lost (the schedule stays overdue until a runtime loads). It is also strictly
    narrower than the behaviour before this branch, when such a record read as
    live for the ~45 s until its heartbeat quieted.

    **A PID IS NOT AN OWNER EITHER — the marker outlives its writer.** The
    marker holds a number, and the kernel hands a reaped process's number to the
    next process that wants one, so this reported a dead runtime's session as
    "already open in pid N" naming an unrelated stranger: every attach path
    refused it and nothing was running (session bfbc971ef537, 2026-09-21). The
    identity comes from the session's ``.execution-lease`` CLAIM, which records
    the birth token of the process that wrote it
    (:func:`local_operator.procstate.same_birth`): when the claim names THIS
    pid and its recorded birth differs from the live process's, the writer is
    gone and this returns ``None``. The marker itself keeps its bare-pid format
    on purpose — ``retention``, ``cleanup`` and this module all parse it as an
    ``int()``, and an unparseable value reads there as "no owner", which is a
    second writer against a live one. A marker with no claim beside it, or a
    claim naming a different pid, has no recorded identity and keeps today's
    pid-liveness behaviour: that is the mixed-generation cell that keeps an
    older build's live owner safe.

    ``include_archived=False`` is the DEFAULT because every caller of this
    function is a LISTING, and an archived conversation is exactly what a
    listing is not supposed to offer. The one caller that must say otherwise is
    ``session.cleanup``'s retention policy, which ranks this listing to decide
    what to KEEP: an archived session dropped from that ranking would stop
    being protected by the recent-N rule and be swept as if it were work nobody
    kept. See :func:`recent_session_rows` for the picker's version of the same
    question.

    ``limit=None`` means NO TRUNCATION and is the default, so a caller that says
    nothing gets the whole store. That direction is deliberate and was learned
    the expensive way: this defaulted to ``10`` while the picker called it with
    no argument, and the "uncapped" picker silently showed ten rows on a
    236-session store — a worse version of the bug the change was written to
    fix. A default that truncates makes forgetting to pass a limit look like
    working code, so the safe default is the complete answer and every caller
    that wants less has to say so at its own call site, where a reader can see
    it.

    Subagent sessions are excluded (:func:`is_user_session`): they are the
    machine's own scratch conversations, and a listing offered to a human is
    about work the human did. They remain resumable by explicit id — nothing
    here removes a directory, and ``hub op='resume'`` continues a child by its
    own path — so this narrows what is OFFERED, never what exists.

    The mtime is RETURNED rather than used and dropped: the sort already reads
    it, and it is the one fact that makes a list of 12-hex ids pickable instead
    of a wall of hashes.

    Best-effort: a directory that vanishes mid-scan (retention sweeps run
    concurrently) is skipped rather than raising out of an error path whose whole
    job is to be helpful.

    The traversal is ``os.scandir``-based over the store, and in the steady
    state a directory already known to be a subagent session costs NOTHING:
    it is skipped from the verdict cache before its marker is stat'd, on facts
    (`name`, `inode`) the ``readdir`` batch already supplied. Only a directory
    the cache cannot answer for pays the origin stat, and only one that
    survives that gate pays the activity stats — see the skip and gate-order
    notes in :func:`_scan_sessions`, which is where the per-directory cost is
    actually decided.

    So per-directory cost is **O(user sessions + directories that are neither
    listed nor cached-hidden)**, not O(the store): measured flat at 266
    syscalls per poll while the store grew 100 -> 8,000 directories with users
    held at 50 (``scripts/bench_catalog_scan.py store-axis``), against
    366 -> 16,166 before.

    STATE THAT MIDDLE TERM, do not round it away. A directory with NEITHER an
    origin marker NOR any activity is in neither ``rows`` nor
    ``hidden_names``: it can never arm the skip, so it pays its origin stat
    and ``load_catalog``'s desktop probe on EVERY poll, forever, while never
    being listable. Measured with users fixed at 50 and hidden fixed at 500,
    varying only that third population (``bench_catalog_scan.py
    unmarked-axis``): 266 / 2,266 / 8,266 / 32,266 at 0 / 500 / 2,000 / 8,000
    — strictly linear at 4.0 syscalls each (agent review round 1, R1, which
    measured 268 -> 32,268 with a counter that also counts ``open`` and
    ``listdir``; the slope is the claim, not the constant). Pinned by
    ``unmarked-axis`` and
    ``test_the_cost_is_linear_in_directories_that_are_neither_listed_nor_hidden``).
    A corrupt marker and ``{"origin": ""}`` behave identically, and the
    corrupt case is the very fail-safe this design preserves. The store
    accumulates these from idle open-and-quit launches — 23 on the reporting
    machine. It is a real limit, RECORDED here rather than left to be
    rediscovered: "tracks the user's own sessions" is true of the hidden
    population and false of this one.

    Fixing that cost is a separate change and is deliberately NOT attempted
    here: caching "unmarked" is refused for the reason stated at the marker
    stat below, and the refusal is load-bearing.

    What is still O(total entries) is the single batched ``scandir`` — the
    poll has stopped stat-ing the store, not stopped touching it — and the
    verdict cache's own parse, which at 7,950 markers is 704 KB / 5.6 ms.
    Those two and the never-active population above are the dominant
    remaining terms; anyone optimising this path next should start there, and
    should count :func:`~local_operator.session.catalog.load_catalog`'s
    desktop probe too — it is the second site, and the hidden set returned by
    :func:`_scan_sessions` is what removed it.

    The store is scanned once rather than each directory
    being scanned individually: the latter is what the origin design proposed,
    and it measures ~2x WORSE (1986 ms vs 1127 ms over 31,700 dirs) because it
    stats every entry in every directory to learn two filenames. Do not "fix"
    it back.

    The cost this used to be dominated by was the ORIGIN check, which ran once
    per directory and therefore scaled with the SUBAGENT population — ~10.6x
    the user population on the reporting machine. Because a marker that EXISTS
    must still be read and parsed (see :data:`ORIGIN_CACHE_NAME`), that was one
    file read per subagent directory: 1127 ms over 31,700 dirs, of which the
    reads were 639 ms. The verdict cache removed the READS (~310 ms warm,
    ``bench/resume-picker-after.json``), and the hidden-skip above removed the
    remaining per-directory STAT. Quote the recorded bench figure here rather
    than a remembered one — an optimistic number in a docstring is how the next
    person's regression looks like an improvement.

    ``limit`` truncates the RESULT, never the work: every directory is visited
    regardless, so a caller asking for all sessions costs the same as one
    asking for ten.

    ``revalidate=True`` opts OUT of the skip for this call, re-reading every
    marker so the answer reflects the store as it is now rather than as the
    last revalidating scan found it. It is for a caller whose decision is
    IRREVERSIBLE — ``session.cleanup`` protects the recent-N by this listing,
    so a stale row there is a deleted conversation, not a missing one. A caller
    that merely DISPLAYS the listing must not set it: the whole point of the
    epoch is that a 2-second poll does not pay a full scan.

    (the picker, to mark a fork) re-opened the same file per row. Returning it
    costs nothing: the read has happened, and for the common unmarked session
    the value is ``""`` with no syscall added at all.

    Private because the public pair is what every other caller wants and the
    CLI's recovery listing pins its shape. Callers that also want the hidden
    names — only ``session.catalog.load_catalog``, to skip a second per-directory
    stat — use :func:`_scan_sessions` directly, and so does the one caller that
    wants the transcript stats (``hidden_names``' third neighbour); this shape

    than being re-derived by the caller for two reasons: the scan has already
    read the index it filtered against, so a second read is a second answer that

    keyed on the transcript's own stat, under which an id archived between two

    """The one store scan: ``(rows, hidden_names, transcript_stats)``.

    ``revalidate=True`` forces this scan to re-read every marker instead of
    serving the armed fast path — the caller declaring that a stale verdict is
    not acceptable to IT, whatever the epoch says. Only a caller that ACTS on
    the listing rather than displaying it should ask for this; see
    ``session.cleanup._picker_rows``, which is a deletion authority and must
    never decide from a speculatively-stale answer.

    ``strict=True`` makes a store that exists but cannot be WALKED an error
    (:class:`~local_operator.session.errors.SessionStoreUnavailable`) instead
    of an empty listing, and the caller declaring it is one whose answer a UI
    adopts as MEMBERSHIP -- ``session.catalog.load_catalog``, which feeds the
    desktop sidebar and the TUI's, and ``recent_session_rows(strict=True)``,
    which feeds the phone's conversation list. A missing store is an empty
    answer in both modes; see the ``FileNotFoundError`` boundary below. Left
    off by default because the OTHER callers document the opposite contract for
    good reason (search, the ``/resume`` picker and the retention policy all
    answer display-only questions, where an error is worse than an empty
    answer) and because flipping it for them is a behaviour change to eight
    surfaces this change has no evidence about. The phone's listing is
    deliberately NOT in that list any more: it publishes rows the client
    replaces wholesale, so an empty answer there is the same membership lie
    this parameter exists to stop, and its own caller declares that.

    ``hidden_names`` is every directory this scan established is NOT the user's
    own session — whether it was skipped from cache or re-read. It exists for
    ``load_catalog``, which otherwise stats a ``desktop.json`` in every
    directory the listing did not return. That probe is answerable without the
    filesystem here: ``desktop.json`` has exactly one writer
    (``server/utils/desktop_sessions.py``'s ``DesktopSessions.create``), which
    mints a fresh ``uuid4`` directory and never writes an origin marker into it,
    so a directory carrying an origin marker cannot also carry a desktop one.
    Skipping the probe for these names is HALF the total saving of this design.

    ``transcript_stats`` is the OTHER half of the same hand-over, and it exists
    for the same one caller: ``session_id -> os.stat_result`` for the transcript
    of every candidate this scan ranked. The clock below stats that file anyway
    to decide whether a directory is a session at all, so this map carries a stat
    that has ALREADY happened — ``session_activity_path(..., seen=...)`` is what
    fills it, so the rule that produced the clock is still the only rule — and
    ``session.catalog``'s row cache is keyed on exactly that file's ``(mtime,
    size)``. Without it, a catalogue build re-stats every listed session's
    transcript on every poll: 200 of the 1204 stats a cold build measured at n=200
    (1 of the 3 stats per listed session above the scan). A candidate whose
    activity is only an unread inbox has NO transcript and therefore no entry
    here, which is the same answer ``session.catalog._row_stat_key`` reaches when
    it stats and finds nothing: the row has no cache key and is rebuilt.

    LIFETIME, because a carried stat is only as good as the window it is trusted
    in: this map is filled by THIS scan and is consumed by the caller's immediate
    work, in the same thread, before the next scan of this store can run. The
    value is therefore never older than the reader's own scan — a later scan can
    only replace it with a NEWER one, and a newer key costs a cache miss (a row
    rebuilt from disk, which is correct by construction), never a stale hit.
    Deliberately not retained in a module-level memo for that reason: a map that
    outlived its scan would have to be invalidated, and this one needs no
    invalidation because it cannot outlive it.

    Cost, stated rather than elided: one dict entry per visible candidate — the
    same population ``rows`` already holds (200 on a 200-visible store, and
    bounded by the store, not by ``limit``: it describes candidates, and ``limit``
    truncates the RESULT). Callers with no use for it ignore the third value; it
    is a third return value rather than a fourth field on each row because every
    other caller unpacks that row shape and none of them wants this.

    Split from :func:`_recent_sessions_with_origin` rather than widening its
    return type because that shape is pinned by the CLI's recovery listing and
    by every other caller, none of which has any use for the second value.

    ``include_archived`` is THE archive predicate for every listing in this
    codebase, and that is the whole design: the picker, the sidebar catalogue,
    the desktop catalogue and the search digests all reach their rows through
    this function, so ONE filter here is what makes those four surfaces agree
    about which conversations exist to be offered. A second filter at a second
    call site is exactly how the sidebar and the phone came to disagree about
    subagent visibility before this scan owned that question too.

    With it off (the default) an archived directory is dropped from ``rows``
    and NOT added to ``hidden_names``: hidden means "not the user's own
    session" and carries a second meaning at ``load_catalog``, where a hidden
    name is one the desktop-marker probe may skip. An archived session is the
    user's own; it is simply not being OFFERED.

    The flag therefore NARROWS WHAT IS OFFERED AND NEVER WHAT EXISTS. An
    archived session still resolves by explicit id (``lop resume <id>``, the
    desktop's ``GET /v1/desktop/sessions/{id}``), exactly as a subagent run
    stays resolvable while the listing hides it — the rule
    ``_recent_sessions_with_origin``'s docstring already states for the other
    axis of visibility.

    The archive index is read AT MOST once per scan and LAZILY: only a
    candidate that has already passed the hidden-origin gate and the
    directory checks reaches the archive decision, so a store whose entries
    are all hidden pays no stat and no read for an answer none of them can
    use, and a store with nothing archived pays one stat and no read (the
    index is stat-ed before it is opened — see ``session.archived``).

    ``0`` RATHER THAN ``None``, and that is this call site's own contract:
    :attr:`SessionRow.delegating` needs a number to add, and both answers mean
    the same thing to it — a value nobody reported can never make a row
    delegating. Nothing here is ever RENDERED, so "not reported" and "zero"
    cannot be confused on a frame; the surfaces that do render a count keep the
    ``None`` (see ``CatalogEntry.status`` and ``session-list.tsx``), which is why

        beside a tooltip reading "Leaving…" — and would draw ``⇉`` next to it.
        A runtime committed to exiting is the stronger fact, so it suppresses
        the state at the one place both readers look.

        ``None`` report is treated as zero FOR THE STATE: an unknown count can
        never make a row delegating. It is still not written as a zero anywhere
        — the label builder in the catalogue omits a count it was not given.
        "Queued with nothing running" is the case that must not read as idle:
        the capacity gate parks a child with ``queued=True`` while it waits for a
        slot (``harness/subagent.py:663``, ``queued = jobs_manager.at_capacity()``
        → ``harness/jobs.py:648``, whose ``at_capacity`` counts only
        non-``queued`` running jobs), so a parent holding only parked children is
        working in exactly the sense the operator is complaining about.

    memorable was still listed under whatever happened to be typed first, and
    a user who could not recall that opening line could not find the session
    at all. That is the reported failure this function closes.

    Scanned out of the raw JSONL rather than replayed through ``Transcript``
    on purpose. This module is import-guarded (see the module docstring): a
    picker row must not drag the engine, the providers or ``asyncio`` onto
    ``local-operator --help``. A regex over two bounded windows is the same
    question asked cheaply.

    BOTH ENDS are read — see :data:`TITLE_SCAN_BYTES` for why a tail-only scan
    missed the title on 78% of real sessions. The LAST match wins across the
    two windows, because each rename appends a full snapshot and the newest row

    """:class:`SessionRow` per resumable session, newest first.

    Layered over :func:`recent_sessions` rather than replacing it: the CLI's
    recovery listing wants only ``(id, mtime)`` and must stay as cheap as it
    is, while the picker pays one extra short read per row for the name.

    Synchronous, and called from the UI thread when the picker opens. That is
    deliberate: each read is bounded (:data:`NAME_SCAN_CHARS`) and stops at the
    first user turn, so the pathological case — a transcript whose first line
    is an 80 MB paste — measures 0.2 ms, and fifty of them are still under a
    frame. Moving this to a worker would trade that for a picker that opens
    empty and fills in, which is worse for a list the user is about to read.

    ``limit=None`` means NO TRUNCATION, matching :func:`recent_sessions` — see
    its docstring for why the untruncated answer is the DEFAULT rather than the
    opt-in. The ``/resume`` picker relies on that default; every caller that
    wants a short list passes its own number at its own call site (the CLI's
    recovery listing, the mobile daemon's history and search), so the cap is
    visible where it is chosen instead of hiding in this signature.

    Uncapping is affordable because the scan underneath is limit-independent
    (see :func:`recent_sessions`) and the only per-row cost added is
    :func:`session_name`, one bounded head read.

    **The fork mark costs nothing on an unmarked session.** The scan already
    parsed every ``origin.json`` that exists, so the verdict is threaded out of
    it (:func:`_recent_sessions_with_origin`) rather than re-read here; a
    session with no marker — the overwhelming majority — adds no syscall at
    all, and only a row already known to be a FORK pays the title probe. An
    earlier revision asked ``wears_inherited_title`` per row unconditionally,
    which attempted two reads per row on a store containing zero forks (the
    absence was discovered from the ``OSError``) and measured +52% on a
    3,000-session store, on this synchronous UI-thread path. That is the exact
    "unmarked is the cheap path" property :func:`recent_sessions` documents at
    length, and it must not be given back here.

    ``strict=True`` forwards to the scan, so a store that exists but cannot be
    WALKED raises :class:`~local_operator.session.errors.SessionStoreUnavailable`
    instead of answering an empty list. It is off by default because these
    callers answer display-only questions in the sense that matters -- a
    picker, a search, a recovery listing -- and an error is worse for them than
    an empty answer; flipping the default would be a behaviour change to eight
    surfaces this parameter has no evidence about.

    THE PHONE'S HISTORY IS NOT ONE OF THOSE, and it is the reason the parameter
    exists at all. ``mobile.daemon`` builds its durable listing from these rows
    and publishes them as the phone's conversation list, which the client
    REPLACES wholesale -- so an unreadable store read as "no conversations" is
    the same confidently-wrong membership this whole change removes from the
    desktop and TUI sidebars, one surface out. That caller passes
    ``strict=True`` and keeps the last listing it did read.

    ``include_archived=False`` keeps archived conversations out of the rows, and
    that is the default every listing wants. The ``/resume`` picker is the one
    caller that passes ``True``: it has a toggle that REVEALS them, so it needs
    the rows in hand and the ``archived`` flag on each one to know which rows the
    toggle is revealing. A caller that only lists (the CLI's recovery listing,
    the phone's history, the search) leaves it off and so cannot offer an
    archived conversation at all.

    operator had opened. A visible workstream row therefore has to carry WHO
    opened it and on whose behalf, which the stamp recorded in the marker at
    creation time (:func:`local_operator.agent_shell.stamp_agent_shell_session`)

    every other row — the overwhelming majority, including every subagent
    directory — pays a comparison. That is the same shape as
    :func:`wears_inherited_title`'s fork probe, for the same reason (an

    listing drawn on a UI thread).

    Deliberately NOT in the scan's return tuple: that shape is pinned by six

    CLI's recovery listing pay for a key it never renders.

    Tolerant like every other reader of this file: a truncated, hand-edited or
    non-object ``opened_by`` yields the three keys as ``None`` rather than a
    raised error, because the row is still the operator's workstream and a
    listing that hid it for a bookkeeping problem would be the worse failure.
