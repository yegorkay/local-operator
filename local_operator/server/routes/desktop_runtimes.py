"""``GET /v1/desktop/runtimes`` — the machine's runtime roster.

The one route in this module, and it answers a single question: **which session
runtimes are alive on this machine, and can each be reached?** The composition
itself lives in :mod:`local_operator.session.runtime.roster`; this module is the
thin HTTP half — authentication, the query surface, and the response model.

**Why it is not derived from ``/v1/desktop/sessions``.** That listing is ranked,
paginated and session-shaped: it walks the session store, and it can only name a
runtime through the discovery record the runtime publishes. On the reference host
34 of 57 live runtimes had no record at all, so a client asking that endpoint could
not learn they existed — the exact gap this route closes (see the architecture
report's §6, and ``roster``'s module docstring for the four sources it composes).

**Why the work happens in a worker thread.** The composition forks ``ps``, forks
``lsof`` and opens up to one socket per runtime. None of that may run on the event
loop: this daemon serves every other desktop request on the same loop, and a
wedged runtime that makes a connect block would turn one roster poll into a stall
for every session in the product.

**How many forks, and why it is now three.** This endpoint used to fork ELEVEN
processes per poll: one ``lsof``, one census ``ps``, one ``ps -Eww``, FIVE
``ps -o ppid= -p <pid>`` (the ancestry walk is one fork per hop) and THREE
``/bin/ps -o pid=,state=,lstart= -p <pids>`` (one per record population — a foreign
root scanned is a batch of its own, and there are up to
``roster.FOREIGN_ROOT_LIMIT`` of them). Measured on the reference host that was
286.1 ms of CPU per poll — 45.3 ms of it this process and **240.8 ms of it
children**, which ``time.process_time()`` cannot see, so the first report of this
path under-counted it 7.5x. At the observed ~1.4 Hz that is 24.0 cpu-s/min for one
polling client against 3.19 cpu-s/min for a whole live ``lop serve``.

Every per-pid reader above is now answered from ONE read of the process table,
opened as a ``roster.process_table_scope`` around both calls below. What is left is
the three forks that are not per-pid: the socket table, the table read itself
(which IS the census, with the state and start-time columns appended) and the
environment dump. The values every reader sees are unchanged — a state field is
read by the same ``procstate`` parser and a census row by the same ``reclaim``
interpreter on both paths — and the whole composition is compared against the
per-pid form by ``tests/unit/session/runtime/test_batched_process_table.py``.

**Why it is bounded, and what the bound returns.** The two things that grow with
the machine — the connects — run inside one wall deadline, enforced rather than
hoped for: the probe pool is shut down without waiting on its queue, and a row
whose probe did not complete inside the budget reports ``reachability:
"unknown"``. The failure this rules out is the one an operator would actually
hit — one runtime that is alive and not answering, holding the whole response
open, or a roster of forty rows spending ``ceil(rows / PROBE_WORKERS)`` times the
connect timeout however small the budget was (review round 1, R1-4). What the
budget does NOT cover is stated in ``roster``'s docstring: the ``ps`` and ``lsof``
reads in front of the probes have their own timeouts and are not part of it, so
the response's ceiling is their sum, not ``budget_s``. A dead pid is never
dialled: ``pid_alive`` (signal-0) answers first and the row reads ``gone``.

**It is a READER, and it changes nothing.** Records and boot records are read with
``reap=False``, the process table and the socket table are external read-only
calls, and the only network traffic is one loopback connect per row. Nothing in
the harness depends on this route answering.
