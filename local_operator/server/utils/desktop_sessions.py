#: The two session-stream frames that BOOKEND a submit's admission, published by

#: live here, beside the other frames this layer composes (``attention``,
#: ``notification``, ``frontend.replace``), because the pool is what gives them
#: their one property: a session-scoped frame delivered to whatever viewer is
#: attached, acquired without a bridge and so without spawning anything.
#:
#: THE PAIR IS THE POINT. ``admission.accepted`` is emitted BEFORE the engage,
#: so every refusal that follows — an unreachable runtime, an owner that leaves
#: mid-admission, a daemon that latches — lands with an acknowledgement already
#: on the viewer's stream; a viewer (or a second viewer, from the replay) that
#: never receives the outcome holds a promise that does not resolve. Both frames
#: carry the caller's own ``request_id``, so a renderer correlates them with each
#: other and with the HTTP receipt.
#:
#: WHAT ``admission.accepted`` CLAIMS, EXACTLY, because a frame a renderer paints
#: as success must not overstate: this host has RECORDED the request and has
#: started engaging a runtime for it. It is NOT the runtime's acknowledgement —
#: that is the HTTP receipt (``status: admitted``), which may be seconds away —
#: and it does not promise the turn ran.
#:
#: BOTH ARE DELIVERED THROUGH THE BRIDGE rather than as a bespoke write, which is
#: what makes them idempotent on reconnect: each takes the bridge's own monotone
#: ``seq`` and enters its replay buffer, so a viewer that reconnects with the
#: epoch and cursor of the connection it lost receives each exactly once instead
#: of not at all. (A FRESH attach replays nothing by design — ``events`` gaps a
#: subscriber that supplies no epoch — and gets the snapshot instead; these frames
#: are about a reconnect mid-admission, which is exactly the case the replay
#: covers.)
#:
#: AND EACH IS BOUNDED, in two ways a reader should not have to reverse-engineer:
#: at most once per request id PER BRIDGE (``publish_once``,
#: ``ANNOUNCED_ADMISSION_HISTORY``), and only for the life of the attachment —
#: the bridge's replay is cleared on an epoch change, so a viewer that arrives
#: after the session went cold reads the durable transcript and the receipt
#: instead. Neither is a durable record of anything.

#: the dial (``attached.py::_dial``). The two are 45 s by agreement rather than by
#: construction, and since a live visible lease now CREATES the runtime, a
#: mismatch is not cosmetic: if this one were raised alone the bridge would keep
#: a lease it calls live while the reaper had already stopped counting the
#: viewer, so the warmed runtime would idle out under a window still waiting to
#: use it. Change them together, or make one derive from the other (review round
#: 1: the architect's cross-reference nit on these two constants).
WATCH_TTL = 45.0

#: Pace of the lease-driven warm, in three parts, because a warm that cannot
#: succeed must not become a spawn per heartbeat.
#:
#: A heartbeat is 15 s and a lease is 45 s, so an attempt left on that cadence
#: is a child spawn every beat for a session whose runtime cannot start
#: (provider credential gone, an MCP hang, an unwritable config dir). That is
#: not a latency optimisation any more, it is an unattended loop, so a FAILED
#: attempt — one that really did try to spawn and left the viewer cold — waits
#: out ``_LEASE_WARM_BACKOFF_S`` and doubles from there to the ceiling. The
#: honest cost of the doubling is that a transient failure is not retried for
#: 30 s; the fallback is the cold bind that shipped before this feature, while
#: the alternative is a machine running out of RAM because a window is open.
#: The ceiling is not a give-up point: the loop keeps re-asking at 120 s for as
#: long as the lease lives, because that is the same intent the beat expressed,
#: at 1/120 of the rate — and it is logged, since a bind that cannot start has
#: no other surface on this path.
#:
#: An attempt that did NO WORK (the facade was in owner recovery, or an engage
#: was already in flight) is explicitly not a failure and does not spend the
#: backoff: it is retried at ``_LEASE_WARM_POLL_S``, which is what carries the
#: intent across the ~8 s recovery window that used to swallow a warm until the
#: next beat. Keep it well under a heartbeat: a click inside that window pays
#: the cold bind this feature exists to remove.

    WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL (review round 3, MAJOR-1). The doubt used to live
    only in the bridge that watched the unknown outcome fail, and that is a copy
    in one process's memory: an eviction at ``BRIDGE_COUNT`` or a plain server
    restart rebuilt the bridge from the MARKER — the very copy the failed
    operation wrote — so the doubt was discarded on exactly the path the finding
    named, and the next move resolved a relative target against it and rewrote
    the durable marker from that base. A successor could then be engaged in a
    directory no party confirmed, while the docs promised the doubt was settled
    against the owner.

    The signature of a half-applied move is durable and readable here: a marker
    that names a DIFFERENT directory from the one the session's LIVE owner
    reports in its own record (``registry.scan``; not a value this server wrote).
    An owner still running in ``before`` while the marker says ``after`` can only
    mean the move did not take — a move is honoured by retiring the owner, and a
    definite refusal restores every copy — so the marker is a failed write and
    the bridge must reconcile before it acts on it.

    Deliberately NARROW, because a false positive costs a move: the doubt is only
    reconstructed when a marker exists and carries a cwd, and when a live owner
    disagrees with the resolved directory. A cold session (no record), a settled
    session (record == marker) and a checkpoint-only directory (no marker to
    doubt) all stay confirmed. The one conservative direction is an owner in the
    seconds of its own retirement: the outgoing record can still name the old
    directory while the successor has not published yet, which flags the doubt
    for that window. That refuses the next move with a reconcile sentence instead
    of acting on a possibly-stale copy, and it clears as soon as the successor's
    own record lands — the safe side of the line this finding is about.

    No separate read is needed for the two arguments: ``marker_cwd`` is the
    cwd the caller already got from the marker (``None`` when the directory came
    from the checkpoint fallback), and ``resolved`` is the directory the bridge
    will run with, so this asks only the question the marker cannot answer.

    Contract §A: an outcome whose answer never came back, or a rollback that
    could not run, is NEITHER a refusal nor a success, so the next operation must
    finish that reconciliation under the move lock instead of acting on an
    optimistic ``_cwd``.

    WHY THE OWNER IS ASKED, AND WHY COMPARING OUR OWN COPIES WAS NOT ENOUGH. The
    durable marker and ``bridge.cwd`` are BOTH written by the same failed
    operation from the same ``resolved`` value, so they agree by construction —
    a guard comparing only those two always reads "settled" and never sees the
    divergence it exists for. The facade is the second self-written copy, but it
    is the one that carries the OWNER'S answer (a definite refusal restores it to
    the directory the owner kept), so it disagrees far more often than the marker
    does. The authoritative account of where a live session works is the owner's
    own record, which is what :func:`_live_owner_cwd` reads.

    Three outcomes, and every one of them acts only on what a party confirms:

    * **The live owner confirms the facade, and the durable copy is the odd one
      out.** A move is honoured only by retiring the owner, so an owner that is
      still live — and whose own record names the directory the facade rolled
      back to — never accepted it. Both parties agree against the marker, which
      is therefore PROVABLY stale: it is repaired to the owner's directory, under
      the move lock, through the same atomic writer the move path uses, and the
      move proceeds. This is the case that used to leave a restart or a bridge
      eviction spawning a successor in a directory the move was REFUSED for.
    * **Every party agrees.** The durable target governs the successor and the
      base a relative new target resolves against; the doubt is settled and the
      flag clears.
    * **Anything else** — a live owner that disagrees with the marker while the
      facade also disagrees, an unreadable payload, an owner-side observation
      that matches neither copy — is genuinely unresolved. It is REPORTED for the
      caller to reconcile (503, the indeterminate class) and never resolved by
      preferring one copy, which is how the previous behaviour overwrote a
      committed move with a stale one.

    The three readbacks are logged at the refusal, so the state that needed
    reconciling is recorded rather than reconstructed later.

            # WHY IT IS NEEDED AT ALL: `retiring` means "a successor is owed,
            # engage one" — the frame a move ends with, and a client-side build
            # refresh too — and the facade answers it with `_go_cold(refresh=True)`,
            # which fires this callback. The TUI installs one
            # (`_on_runtime_refreshed`); without one the desktop viewer simply sat
            # cold until the user's next send engaged, so a moved session's chip
            # stayed on the OLD directory with nothing to settle it. (A
            # WHOLE-DAEMON retirement is a different case with its own mechanism,
            # `server/retire.py`: the callback still fires there and declines in
            # `_schedule_warm`, because the daemon leaving needs no successor
            # spawned inside it.) Nothing else can take this job:
            # `attach_existing()` only adopts an EXISTING owner record (there is
            # none after a retire), and warm()/prompt()/command only re-engage when
            # the user next acts.
            #
            # WHY THE CALLBACK AND NOT "warm() after the move route returns": at
            # the moment `set_working_directory` returns, the outgoing client is
            # usually STILL connected (`retire_now` is acked before the EOF), so an
            # engage issued there samples `is_cold` as False and returns without
            # doing anything — silently. This callback runs on the exact frame
            # that flips the viewer cold, which is the only moment that is not a
            # race. It fires from `_on_disconnected` inside the client's pump, i.e.
            # on the event loop, so `_schedule_warm` may create its task directly.

        The child reader's live half (design § 1). ``child_id`` is a JOB id, not
        the child's session id: the retained window lives on the job, every
        lookup path beneath this method is job-keyed, and a child that ran more
        than one attempt has several job ids over one directory — the reader
        holds one of them. The reply IS the seed (see
        :class:`~local_operator.server.models.desktop_sessions
        .ChildTrajectoryWindow`), because a client that had to fetch and then
        subscribe would lose whatever landed between the two calls.

        The subscription this opens must be closed by the ``DELETE`` of the same
        path, and the reply says what this open did to the count: ``watchers``
        is how many readers hold this child's window after the call (``1`` for an
        open, more when it joined one a sibling window already had live) and
        ``joined`` is its boolean form. Every POST increments and one DELETE
        releases one, so a client that re-seeds without unmounting accumulates a
        reference; stating the count is what makes that observable instead of
        invisible.

        THE CALLER HAS ALREADY TAKEN THIS BRIDGE, in the read envelope, and that
        split is deliberate: a subscribe is not work, so a cold conversation must
        not be STARTED by someone opening a child's page, and a busy owner must
        not fail the read. The envelope therefore belongs to the route that owns
        the door, while everything below it — the containment proof, the job-type
        question and the seed — needs a bridge and reads it here.

        THE REFERENCE IS COUNTED PER JOB ON THIS BRIDGE (see
        :meth:`watch_trajectory`): one bridge is shared by every window watching
        the session, so an unload that was not counted would silently freeze
        another window's reader. The matching release is the ``DELETE`` route.

        A CONTAINMENT PROOF RUNS FOR EVERY CHILD JOB (:func:`_contained_child_job`),
        so a job id that is not one of this conversation's own children is refused
        rather than subscribed: the route takes ids and never a path, and the
        proof — not the caller — decides that this job belongs to this parent. It
        sits behind the job-type question below, which is a different question
        rather than a way around it.

        Three answers, and the distinctions are load-bearing:

        * a refusal (404 ``child_not_found``) for an id that does not name one of
          this conversation's child jobs;
        * ``available: false, reason: "unsupported"`` for a job type that records
          no trajectory at all — the reader stops asking;
        * ``available: false, reason: "no-owner"`` when there is nothing live to
          read the window from — no owner is attached, the owner is too old for
          the subscription op, or the connection dropped mid-fetch. Retryable, so
          the reader keeps its pulse.

        would mark the completion delivered while nobody was told, for good. A
        frame is an OFFER; the renderer claims through ``POST /notified``
        immediately before it shows the banner.

        NO OFFER IS MADE FROM A SILENCED PROCESS EITHER, and the swap is
        deliberate: a frame nobody may raise is worth neither the compose nor
        the round trip, and the renderer's own banner is what the operator
        complains about. Same two questions as the machine-wide feed (see
        ``desktop_feed._emit_notifications``): the process switch settles
        whether THIS backend may notify, the per-session read settles whether
        the conversation was ever run on the mock — the case here being a
        session a rig left in a store this backend serves.

        Guarded end to end: a notification is chrome, and this runs inside the
        1 s attention poll whose loop already treats a store error as costing
        one tick rather than the feature.

            # another. A spawn/exit cycle per heartbeat is strictly worse

            #
            # * ONE RUNTIME PER SESSION, held by the EXISTING lock. Every
            #   attempt is `warm()` — the single engage path that is
            #   `_ensure_bound`, the only place a viewer creates a process — so
            #   a command arriving mid-warm and two attempts contending all
            #   serialise on `_bind_lock` and the loser returns at its own
            #   `is_cold` check. No second spawn path, and no per-subscriber
            #   multiplication: the bridge is per-session and one task per
            #   bridge is `warm()`'s own rule.
            # * THE LEASE IS THE LIFETIME, and the constant that decides it is
            #   the RUNTIME-side `DESKTOP_WATCH_LEASE_S`
            #   (`session/runtime/types.py`) — the same value as `WATCH_TTL`
            #   (45 s) by agreement today rather than by construction, read a
            #   third time by the dial (`attached.py::_dial`). `WATCH_TTL` here
            #   is the BRIDGE's subscription lease, which is what the renderer
            #   renews. Stop heartbeating — window closed, killed, navigated
            #   away — and the lease expires, the runtime falls out of term 3,
            #   and the existing drain reaps it exactly as it reaps one this
            #   change did not start; nothing here holds a process past the
            #   lease.
            # * THE AGGREGATE IS THE FOCUSED WINDOW, NOT ONE RUNTIME. One
            #   runtime per session says nothing about how many SESSIONS can be
            #   warm at once: `BRIDGE_COUNT` (64) sessions can hold a bridge
            #   while their event stream is open, and only eviction at
            #   `users == 0` bounds them. What makes "no cap" safe is that
            #   `visible` is `visibilityState === "visible" && hasFocus()` and
            #   the app mounts ONE lease-bearing chat view per focused window,
            #   so the warm is one runtime at a time — measured here at ~82 MB
            #   idle for the runtime, against the ~283 MB `process.py` budgets
            #   for one. A future that mounts several lease-bearing views at
            #   once (a split pane, a per-pane lease, a "watching" surface that
            #   asserts `visible` without focus) multiplies that by the number
            #   of panes and NEEDS a real cap; the cap today is this gate, and
            #   it is a consequence of the UI rather than of this code.
            # * AN ATTEMPT THAT FAILED IS PACED. The retry loop (see
            #   `_lease_warm_loop`) keeps a live lease's intent across attempts,
            #   but a bind that could not start — the failing-spawn shape — waits
            #   out a doubling backoff rather than re-engaging on every beat,
            #   and an attempt that was refused before doing any work is retried
            #   at the poll pace instead. Both numbers are argued on their
            #   constants.
            # * NOTHING ELSE CREATES ANYTHING. A hidden or notify-only
            #   viewer is the `not visible` return above: `can_notify` is
            #   delivery reachability, not attention, and a window nobody
            #   is looking at is not about to type. Deliberately NARROWER
            #   than term 3, which still counts `visible or can_notify` to
            #   preserve an existing runtime — that policy is untouched.

        WHY A LOOP RATHER THAN ONE ATTEMPT PER BEAT, which is how this started.
        Two ways one attempt is silently lost, both ending in the cold bind the
        warm exists to remove:

        * **The facade cannot engage yet.** `_ensure_bound` returns at its own
          ``_recovering`` guard — no error, and no task to report it — and a
          viewer that has just lost its runtime sits there for up to
          ``COLD_FALLBACK_S`` (8 s; ~9.4 s measured end to end on this path,
          because the loop pays dial pacing on the way out). An attempt landing
          in that window does NOTHING, and the renderer's next beat is 15 s
          away while the user usually clicks first. What marks this as not a
          failure is exactly that it did no work.
        * **An engage is already in flight** (`engage_in_flight`) — the lock
          held by another subscriber's `attach_existing`, say — so `warm()`
          starts no task and, again, nothing retries for a whole beat.

        AN ATTEMPT THAT ACTUALLY RAN is the third case and is handled
        differently, because it DID work: it spawned. Retrying that on the beat
        is the spawn loop a heartbeat alone could drive, so it pays a doubling
        backoff (base and ceiling argued on the constants) and the failure is
        logged, since a bind that keeps failing has no other surface on this
        path. The charge follows the ATTEMPT, not its outcome at the post-await
        check: a runtime that comes up and then dies passes that check and would
        otherwise be re-spawned by the next beat, one failure shape over from
        the case this pacing was built for (review round 2, MINOR-1).

        NOT A SECOND SPAWN PATH: every attempt is `warm()`, the ordinary
        background engage through `_ensure_bound` and the one `_bind_lock`. This
        loop decides only WHEN to ask, never how.

        BOUNDED BY THE LEASE, WHICH IS THE POINT. It exits the moment the viewer
        is bound, the facade is replaced, no live visible lease remains, or the
        session has been deliberately stopped — and it re-asks all four on every
        pass rather than trusting the state at arm time, which is also why a
        backoff is waited out in slices rather than in one long sleep: a lease
        withdrawn during the wait ends the retries within one slice instead of
        after up to two minutes of them.

        EVERY EXIT THAT IS NOT "the viewer is bound" IS AN ABANDONED INTENT and
        drops the pace with it; the bound exit keeps its charge, for the
        crash-loop reason above.

        THE SAME QUESTION the pool's door asks (``DesktopSessions.session``, which
        every route comes through), kept as a bridge method for the callers that
        never arrive through a route: ``warm``'s own speculation, the lease-warm
        loop, and anything else this process starts on its own behalf. Those may
        not delegate to a route's refusals, so the question has to be askable
        here.

        The per-route history is why the DOOR, not this method, is now the
        enforcement: this check reached the three routes that called it
        (``/messages``, ``/commands``, ``/answers``) and the routes that did not
        (``/mcp``, ``/credentials``, ``/fork``, ``/asides``, ``/adopt``) reached
        ``bind_runtime()`` on a latched daemon instead (review round 2, MAJOR-1).
        The bridge-level call is a second pair of eyes, not the mechanism.

        Delegates the QUESTION to the pool's probe rather than reading a flag of
        its own, for the reason the probe exists: the answer changes once, mid-
        life, in the daemon rather than in any bridge.

        """Start a runtime for this session without submitting any work.

        REFUSED WHILE LATCHED, before anything else: this is the one path that
        SPAWNS a session runtime from this process (``warm_runtime`` below), and
        a daemon that is about to exit must not start a runtime whose viewer
        would follow it onto a dead address. The refusal is typed so the route
        answers a named 503 rather than a 500 (see ``DaemonRetiring``), and it
        is checked before the ``remote is None``/cold branches so a latched
        daemon refuses uniformly rather than only when it happens to be cold.
        The decision itself lives in :meth:`assert_admitting`, which this bridge
        shares with the pool's door (``DesktopSessions.session``) — the routes
        reach that door, this loop reaches this method, and both read one probe.

        Returns the state at RETURN TIME — ``"warm"``, ``"warming"`` — never the
        eventual outcome, because every caller fires this speculatively (a
        keystroke, or a live visible watch lease) and has nothing to do with an
        answer either way.

        FIRE AND FORGET, DELIBERATELY. The engage runs in a detached task so the
        HTTP response returns in the ~12-40 ms a warm send costs while the spawn
        proceeds behind it. Awaiting the engage here would not remove the
        ~1.15 s cold cost, it would only move it from the send to the warm — and
        onto a request the renderer issues while the user is still typing.

        IDEMPOTENT, AND ITS SAFETY IS THE LOCK'S, NOT THIS CHECK'S. Both early
        returns are cost avoidance: an already-bound viewer needs no task, and
        an engage already in flight needs no second one. If two warms raced past
        ``engage_in_flight`` anyway, ``_ensure_bound``'s ``_bind_lock``
        serialises them and the loser returns at its own ``is_cold`` check, so
        two warms can never spawn two runtimes. Do not "strengthen" this into a
        lock of its own: a second lock beside the one that already decides the
        question is how the two answers drift apart.

        THE ENGAGE LIVES ONLY AS LONG AS THE BRIDGE, which constrains the
        CALLER and is not visible from this method alone. A bridge is
        reference-counted; ``_detach()`` cancels the warm below so a spawn
        cannot outlive the facade it was started against. The warm request is
        itself a user of that bridge, so a warm issued while nobody else holds
        one is cancelled the instant its own request releases — correct, and
        also useless. It is not a problem for the real caller because the
        renderer warms from a composer inside a mounted session panel, which
        holds an events subscription for its whole life. A future change that
        moves the warm outside that panel, or a probe that warms with no
        subscription open, gets a warm that does nothing and a send that still
        pays the full cold engage.

        TWO CALLERS, ONE SPAWN PATH, AND ONE RETRY RULE. The renderer asks for
        it explicitly (``POST /warm``, first keystroke — a user action, so this
        path is never paced) and the lease-driven retry loop
        (:meth:`_lease_warm_loop`, armed by :meth:`refresh_watch`) asks on
        behalf of a live VISIBLE watch lease, so a session being looked at is
        warm before the first click rather than after it. Both go through the
        guards below and through ``_ensure_bound``; a third one is how two
        answers to "is a runtime needed" would drift apart. The ``done()``
        clause below is what lets the loop tell a settled attempt from a live
        one, and it is deliberately NOT where the pacing lives: a retry that
        no user is behind belongs to the loop, which owns the backoff.

        THERE IS NO ``retire_if_unused`` COUNTERPART HERE, and its absence is a
        decision rather than an oversight. The TUI offers its runtime back
        because the TUI QUITS and must hand over before its socket dies. The
        desktop app does not: a desktop attach only counts as an interactive
        viewer while its watch lease is live AND the window says visible or
        notifiable, so a warmed session the user navigates away from stops
        counting and the runtime's own residency drain reaps it seconds later.
        Calling ``retire_if_unused`` here would be a second mechanism beside a
        working one, and a strictly worse one — it answers "no runtime attached"
        whenever the client is None, which is precisely the state a bridge in
        the middle of a warm is in.

        move and for a client-side build refresh: "a successor is owed; engage
        one". The TUI has answered it since the build-refresh work landed
        (``_on_runtime_refreshed``, installed at the same seam); the desktop had
        no callback installed at all, so a retired runtime left the viewer cold
        and the chip showing the OLD directory until the user's next send
        happened to engage — the gap this feature's own move exposed.

        A MOVE IS THE CASE THIS EXISTS FOR, AND IT IS THE ONE NOBODY ELSE
        COVERS. A whole-daemon retirement (``server/retire.py``, a build update)
        has its own mechanism and this callback deliberately declines during it:

        replaced needs no successor spawned inside it. A session runtime retired
        by the VIEWER — which is exactly what a move is — has nothing else: the
        daemon is healthy, nobody is going to replace it, and the successor is
        owed by this frame alone.

        EAGER rather than lazy, for the reason the TUI is: the next prompt would

        repaints the chip in the meantime, and the successor's own bind is what

    this module's invention:

    * the roster SIDECAR, replaced atomically by
      ``Session._persist_subagent_roster`` on every roster move — the store a
      current runtime writes; then
    * the legacy ``subagent_roster`` transcript custom entry, written once by
      builds that predate the sidecar, so a conversation last run by one of
      those still opens its children — **accepted only when it was appended
      after this session's fork boundary**.

    That is exactly ``Session._load_subagent_roster``'s order AND its fork
    guard, deliberately not re-derived here: two readers of one ownership
    record that disagree is the defect ``session/restored_rows.py`` exists to
    prevent, and the fork case is where this reader used to be the one that
    disagreed (review round 1, R1-1). ``fork_session`` CLONES the parent's
    transcript — so the parent's entry is present VERBATIM in the fork — while
    ``fork.EXCLUDED_SIDECARS`` leaves the sidecar behind. Without the guard a
    fork inherits the original's children as its own and can read them through
    its own route; with it, only a fork's OWN roster (written after
    ``forked_at``) counts. Re-stamping the sidecar happens on the fork's first
    roster move, so the fallback is what a fresh fork rides until then.

    The design's ``subagent_roster`` custom-entry wording predates the v0.40.0
    sidecar; the sidecar holds the same ``records`` list and is newer, so it is
    consulted first and the entry is the fallback, never the other way round.

    Runs off the event loop like every other reader here. It used to construct a
    ``Transcript`` for the legacy fallback, which parsed the parent's whole
    journal; it now takes the same backward one-row read the rest of this module
    does (``read_latest_custom_entry``), so the roster read is bounded by the
    distance from EOF to the newest roster row rather than by the journal, and a
    roster read must not block the loop a streaming turn is using either way.

    This is the whole containment proof of the child read route (design § 9.1),
    and every clause carries weight. It is a new READ PATH ACROSS A TRUST
    BOUNDARY — the renderer holds an absolute ``session_dir`` on the wire and
    must never be able to ask for one — so the route proves membership here, in
    the server, and the caller asserts nothing:

    * **Both ids are ids, never paths.** The same 12-hex-character shape the
      whole desktop surface validates a session on. Checked before any path is
      built, so a crafted value cannot reach ``sessions/`` through ``..`` (a
      directory name is not a legal id).
    * **The parent is the user's own conversation.** A child route scoped to a
      subagent or a fork would make the graph reachable from either end; only a
      conversation the user opened may name its children (``is_user_session``).
    * **The parent's persisted roster names this child.** Membership is not
      inferred from the directory layout, because every session directory looks
      alike on disk; the parent has to have recorded the launch. The record's
      ``session_dir`` must point at exactly ``sessions/<child_id>`` with the
      resolved sessions root as its parent, so a hand-edited record cannot
      redirect a read outside the store.
    * **The target resolves inside the store.** The id cannot be a path, but the
      DIRECTORY it names can be a link, and the store is writable by anything
      running as the user — so a symlinked ``sessions/<12-hex>`` would take the
      read (and the checks below) out of the store while every clause above
      still passed (review round 1, R1-2). The path is resolved and the
      resolved path is what the rest of this function — and the caller — then
      treats as the child, so the thing checked is the thing read. That is the
      same gate ``session/cleanup.py`` applies before it removes a directory
      and the legacy chat route applies before it opens a file.
    * **A child that is still on disk is marked a subagent.** Reversing the
      parent's rule: a user conversation or a fork must be unreadable through
      this route even if it somehow appears in a roster. A directory that is
      ABSENT is not refused here — the caller answers that with the derived
      ``gone`` state, which is the one case where the absence itself is the
      answer. A path that EXISTS and is not a directory is not a child session
      at all, so it is refused too rather than reported as ``gone``: it claims
      a deletion that never happened (review round 1, R1-5).

    Deliberately does NOT acquire a desktop bridge: answering must never start,
    attach to or wake a runtime. The live comms graph may *confirm* membership
    when the runtime happens to be attached, but nothing here reads it — a
    route that a paused session answers identically is a route with no second

    The job-keyed sibling of :func:`_contained_child_dir`, and the two answer
    different questions: that one proves "this session directory is a child this
    conversation launched", which is what needs a page of its transcript; this
    one proves "this JOB row is one of this conversation's children", which is
    what needs a subscription to its live events. Keying the subscription on the
    child's session id instead would force the bridge to resolve "the job for
    this child" itself, and a child with a superseded attempt has TWO job ids over
    one directory — the reader holds one of them and would be shown the other
    attempt's events, silently.

    Every clause carries the weight that function's docstring states, and two of
    them differ on purpose:

    * **Membership comes from the parent's LIVE roster first** (``roster``, the
      session's own canonical job rows as its owner published them) and from the
      parent's persisted record second (:func:`_persisted_child_for_job`). The
      live half is the stronger witness where it exists — it is the running
      session's own job table, so a launch is in it the moment it is admitted,
      with no write window — and it is the only half that can answer for a child
      whose directory is not materialised yet. What the roster must never be is
      the CALLER's claim: it is read from the owner's canonical state, never from
      the request.
    * **The child's directory may be absent.** A trajectory lives on the JOB, in
      memory, so a child that has not written a directory yet is still
      followable. As in :func:`_contained_child_dir`, an ABSENT directory is not
      a refusal; what is refused is a path that exists and is not a subagent
      child.

    Deliberately does NOT read the filesystem beyond the paths above: this is the
    gate in front of a subscription, so it runs before anything is attached,

    published window, so a run of rows emitted between the owner's last publish
    and the seed's install arrives twice — once inside the seed and once as an
    append. 16 opens on a live child reproduced it on every open after the first

    kept as they are: identity is what makes the rule possible, and position
    stays the documented fallback for a reader holding them.

    Only the SEED goes through this. An append may still repeat a row the seed
    already carried — the owner re-delivers from its own last published window

    is the ordinary case, not an edge one — a pin made on an older conversation
    would otherwise have no row anywhere in the app, with no count and no trace
    of it. The operator's store is the measured case: 5,267 sessions against a
    500-row page.

    The TUI reports the same FACT differently, which is why this is not simply
    the desktop half of one promise. A TUI SIDEBAR holds its whole listing and
    draws only a window of it, so an off-page pin is COUNTED there —
    ``+N more pinned — scroll`` — and reachable by scrolling; it does not draw
    its row either. A client that holds one page has no scroll to offer and no
    listing to count against, so the row itself has to come with the answer.
    (``pinned_hidden_ids``, the parameter that sentence is usually about, is the
    other axis entirely: it keeps a HIDDEN session resolvable in the entries a
    sidebar scrolls, where a hidden id is absent because the catalogue never
    built it. An off-page id IS built and is dropped by the ``limit`` slice.)

    TWO LISTS, NOT ONE, and the route concatenates them for the wire. They are
    kept apart here because they answer different questions and only the caller

    ``pinned_off_page`` is everything below it that the user pinned. The wire
    answer is their concatenation, which is also RANK ORDER — every extra ranks
    below every page row by construction — so a client that renders the two as
    one list needs no sort and no marker field.

    ``truncated`` keeps its original meaning — the ranking held more rows than
    the page — and deliberately says nothing about the extras: a client uses it

        * **An in-flight HTTP operation** — any bridge with ``users > 0``. Every
          desktop route runs inside ``session()``, which brackets the request
          with ``acquire()``/``release()`` (``DesktopSessionBridge.acquire``),
          so a non-zero count means a client is holding this bridge open RIGHT
          NOW. For a request that is building a response that is a few tens of
          milliseconds; for the app's event stream it is the whole life of the
          view (see below), and this docstring used to claim the first while
          meaning only it.
        * **A STANDING attachment** — the same ``users`` term, held by
          ``GET /v1/desktop/sessions/{id}/events``, which acquires the bridge
          before it returns response headers and releases it only when the
          stream tears down: an unbounded, replayable relay with no turn
          boundary and no TTL. This is the term that decides the SHAPE of the
          daemon's retirement — the announcement has to precede the drain,
          because this stream is only released when the client decides to
          (``server/retire.py``'s module docstring).
        * **An open attach with a LIVE watch lease** — a window is looking at
          this session (``DesktopSessionBridge._live_leases``, renewed by
          ``watch`` and expiring after ``WATCH_TTL``, which the app renews every
          15 s): the operator's "a viewer is never pulled out from under" rule
          applied to the process that serves it. Counts whether or not the
          window is visible or focused.
        * **A runtime being started** — a bridge with a warm task still
          running (``DesktopSessionBridge.warm_task``, set by ``warm`` and by
          the lease-driven retry loop). A spawn is a handshake with a child
          process that takes ~1.2 s; exiting in the middle of one leaves the
          engage unfinished against a successor that has no idea it was
          running. Bounded by the engage's own attempt budget, and not covered
          by ``users`` — ``warm`` is fire-and-forget and answers the request
          before the handshake completes.

        Read WITHOUT ``watch_lock`` on purpose, and that is safe: this is a
        synchronous filter over an in-process dict on the event loop, so it
        cannot interleave with a mutation. The lock ``_live_leases``'s other
        callers take guards the ACTIONS they then take on the result, not the

          in the half of it that has already happened. Both the spawn and the

          that a reconnect cannot rebuild.

        NOT listed, on purpose:

        * **An in-flight HTTP operation.** An ordinary desktop request is tens of
          milliseconds and a client retries it; the long ones on this plane are
          the relays, below.
        * **A standing attachment** — ``GET /v1/desktop/sessions/{id}/events``
          holds a bridge for the whole life of the view, and the watch lease
          beside it is renewed every 15 s. Those are EXACTLY what a reload is
          allowed to cut and a latch is not: the app re-opens the relay and
          re-reads history, and the turn itself is running inside the runtime,

        DELEGATED RUNS too — a delegated run is a HIDDEN session, and pins are
        kept resolvable across BOTH visibility axes (``pinned_hidden_ids`` for
        the hidden one, ``pinned_off_page`` for a visible session outside a
        page) — and a desktop pin the user cannot remove is the worst shape of
        bug in this feature: the remedy for an unwanted pin is the thing such a
        check would refuse. A delegated run lives in `sessions/` like every other
        session, so the id-shape check plus the is-dir check is the whole
        admission test.

        Cold like its neighbour: no bridge, no runtime, no receipt. The write is

        Returns the answer the route publishes, whose ``pinned`` is the state the
        store settled on. Today that is always the requested state — with ONE
        exception worth naming, because the response reads as a durability claim
        and is not one: on a config root this process cannot write,
        ``_write_pins`` swallows its ``OSError`` by the never-raise contract the
        store inherits from ``toggle_pin``, so this echoes the request over a file
        that did not change and the client renders a pin the store does not hold
        until its next catalogue read settles the row. Deliberately not fixed
        here: escaping the failure would break that pinned contract, and a
        read-back would reintroduce the race between the two writers that the
        store documents as accepted. A backend whose config root is read-only
        cannot serve this feature at all, and "the state the store settled on"
        is not a claim that every ``os.replace`` succeeded.

          Deleting is irreversible and the user cannot see the row they are
          naming; the reversible verb above keeps the looser admission, and that
          asymmetry is the point.
        * **409** (:class:`SessionDeletionRefused`, the guard sentence) when a
          hard guard refuses: a live claim or lease, an armed wake, unread
          spooled mail, or a guard that could not be evaluated. NOT 404, because
          the conversation exists and the user can see it; NOT 500, because
          nothing failed — the machine is in a state the user can clear, and the
          sentence says which one.

        Runs the whole decision on a WORKER THREAD: the guards stat records,
        read the wake index and touch spooled mail, and the removal itself walks
        a directory — none of which may block the loop a streaming turn is using.

        Receipt-free, like ``set_pin`` and unlike the mutating routes around it.

        the same end state the caller asked for.

        THE DAEMON FORGETS THE SESSION on the way out, and that is a consistency
        requirement rather than tidiness: this pool serves a conversation it has

        because the per-session route can only clear what it is told, one call at
        a time, and the desktop sidebar's pile of marks is thousands of
        conversations the user would have to open one by one.

        NOT a sweep, and the distinction is the whole safety story. The caller
        sends the completions it actually RENDERED, each ``(session_id,
        token)``; the store's own compare (:meth:`AttentionStore.
        acknowledge_many`) runs inside the write transaction against each
        item's CURRENT token, so a completion published after the client's

        "mark everything read" form: that would advance watermarks by the
        daemon's MAX(sequence) and silently clear results nobody saw.

        The conversation identity is DERIVED here (``session/<id>``) and never
        taken from the caller -- the client names a session id and nothing else,
        so it cannot write receipts for identities it cannot enumerate. An item
        whose id is malformed, whose directory is gone, or which is not one of
        the user's own sessions is answered ``unknown`` FOR THAT ITEM rather
        than refused for the call: one stale row in a batch of forty must not

        ``read`` entries are the store's own post-write state dicts, which is
        what the list route already publishes per row -- the caller needs no
        second read to learn what its rows now say. ``superseded`` and
        ``unknown`` are the two verdicts that mean "not cleared", so a consumer
        can name the remainder instead of reporting a clean sweep it did not
        get.

        ONE worker hop for the whole batch, and ONE transaction inside it: the
        per-item validation is a directory stat, so doing it per item on the
        event loop would be a blocking ladder, while splitting the write would
        expose a partially applied batch. A ``sqlite3.Error`` propagates to the
        shared failure ladder (``session/store_failures``), which splits it
        by condition -- contention answers the retryable 503, an unreadable or

        silently dead and every bridged session got a second, machine-wide
        banner composed for it. Returning the prefixed form from HERE rather
        than letting the feed normalise is deliberate: the pool is the thing that
        knows its own keys, and a conversion at the consumer would have to be
        repeated for every future consumer that gets it wrong the same way.

        A BRIDGE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH, and that is the second half of the finding.
        A pooled bridge can be retained after its last subscriber left — that is
        what ``BRIDGE_COUNT`` and ``bridge.users`` exist for — and such a bridge
        publishes to nobody, so excluding it would open a background-notification
        HOLE where the prefix fix had just closed a duplicate-banner one. The
        predicate is therefore a LIVE, non-overflowing subscriber that can
        actually notify: the same filter ``_live_leases`` applies, plus
        ``can_notify``. Deliberately NOT ``_live_leases`` itself — that one
        requires ``watch_lock`` and is read under it, while this runs from the
        feed's poller, which must never take a lock the runtime's watch path can
        hold.

        ``limit`` IS THE PAGE SIZE and the truncation verdict is computed here,
        because the two are one question: the caller used to ask for
        ``limit + 1`` rows and slice them itself to learn whether the store held
        more, and that trick cannot survive rows that are deliberately appended
        BEYOND the page (see ``SessionPage.pinned_off_page``) — the count would
        no longer mean what it is read to mean.

        The catalogue itself refuses rather than lying when the store cannot be
        walked (``load_catalog`` is strict), so everything below is about the
        DECORATION: a row that could not have its live state or wake index read
        says so in ``degraded`` instead of presenting the defaults as verdicts.
        The field is always present and always a list, so a client can read it
        without a presence check; ``attention`` below stays sparse because it
        is a per-row fact rather than a read-level one — and when THAT read is
        the one that failed, the affected rows name it in ``degraded``, so an
        absent ``attention`` key is never published as "nothing unread".

        ``status_stamps`` is ``(epoch, {session_id: revision})`` from the desktop
        feed, and it exists because TWO writers now ship the same fact: this row's
        ``status`` and the feed's ``session_status`` frame. A response computed
        before a frame this client already applied would otherwise clobber it —
        and the in-app marker effect fires a list on exactly the transition the
        frames speed up, so the race is the normal path rather than a
        hypothetical. A row whose session the feed has never published for is
        stamped with NEITHER key, and a client reads that as "no comparison
        available, take the list's value".

        The two facts TRAVEL TOGETHER and neither may displace the other:
        ``degraded`` says which read behind a row failed, the stamps say whether
        the row predates a frame this client has already applied, and a listing
        can be fully stamped and still be degraded — the stamps are per-row and
        optional, the marker is per-row and always present.

        Additive and defaulted: nothing else that lists sessions reads it, and an
        unstamped response is byte-identical to what this returned before.
        ``SessionRow`` is ``extra="allow"``, so the two keys serialize without a
        model change.

        ``scope``/``cursor``/``with_counts`` are the SCOPED, paged half of the
        listing (``session.catalog.catalogue_page``), all three defaulted so that
        a caller that passes none of them gets byte-for-byte the answer this
        returned before: the head page, the whole visible ranking, the append-
        below-the-page pins, and no cursor and no counts.

        THE PINS ARE APPENDED ON THE HEAD ANSWER ONLY. ``pinned_off_page`` exists
        because a client that holds one page cannot otherwise render a pin made on
        an older conversation, and that argument is about the listing as a whole —
        which only the head request speaks for. A scoped answer carrying them
        would be handing the client rows belonging to other teams under this
        team, and the client gates its pin facts on the head answer for exactly
        this reason.

        lease holds it, yielding only after ``_BACKGROUND_YIELD_BUDGET_S``

          a session with no runtime stays without one, which is the same
          property ``server/utils/desktop_feed.py`` is built around.
        * ``False`` when there is no resident bridge, and that is not a failure
          to report: a bridge exists exactly while something holds one (a
          route, or the ``/events`` subscription a renderer reads), so "no
          bridge" means there is no reader to tell. The caller's own request

        ``test_serve_retire.py``'s walk), so one refusal covers every path that
        can admit or start work: the five round 1 gated, the five
        ``routes/desktop_lifecycle.py`` handlers review round 2 measured reaching
        ``bind_runtime()`` unrefused (``/mcp``, ``/credentials``, ``/fork`` and
        its child admission, ``/asides``, ``/adopt``), and every route a later
        edit adds.

        WHY THE DOOR RATHER THAN THE ROUTES. A list of gated routes is the defect
        this replaces, not the fix: ``/messages`` was gated, ``/commands`` was
        gated, and ``/mcp`` was not — three answers to one question, drifting
        apart exactly as fast as routes are added. The route-by-route
        enumeration survives only as a TEST (the refusal matrix and the walk in
        ``tests/unit/server/test_serve_retire.py``), where a new route shows up
        as a missing row instead of as a silently ungated path.

        READS ARE REFUSED TOO, and that is a deliberate narrowing of what this
        module used to claim. A session-scoped request handed to a process that
        has already told its readers to leave can only be served by the build it
        is leaving, and the typed refusal is the one answer that moves the client
        on (``DaemonRetiring``'s message says to reconnect to the successor).
        What stays readable is the RECORD plane, which is not this method and not
        this pool: ``GET /v1/desktop/sessions``, ``GET /health`` and the record
        file itself keep answering until the clean exit removes them, which is
        what lets any reader observe the handover.

        THE 404 BELONGS TO THE LOOKUP, NOT TO THE REFUSAL, so it is decided
        first: an unknown session is unknown whether or not this daemon is
        leaving, and keeping that answer stable is what makes "the 503 is the
        LATCH answering" a readable control in the evidence rather than an
        artefact of routing.

        WHAT THE POOL LOCK DECIDES, AND WHAT IT NO LONGER DOES. ``self.lock`` is
        the pool's single answer to one question — *which bridges are resident,
        and which of them may be evicted* — and it is held only for the frames
        that read or change that: the handout reservation, the cached lookup, the
        ``BRIDGE_COUNT`` eviction and the insertion. It is deliberately NOT held
        across either slow half of opening a session. Holding it there is what let
        one conversation's open become every other conversation's wait: measured on
        the operator's live backend, a 642-byte session's snapshot answered in
        **25 ms alone but 829 ms** while the 261 MB session's open was in flight,
        and the 261 MB open itself took 32.1 s (with a 96 MB open returning 503
        after 25.4 s) because a cold open queues behind the pool. Two mechanisms
        replace the lock's old reach here, and neither is a second lock: the
        ``_handouts`` count keeps a resolved-but-not-yet-acquired bridge out of the
        eviction path (``_evictable``), and ``_locate_flights`` single-flights a
        cold session's lookup so racing callers share one journal read. The bridge
        keeps its OWN lock for its own state — that one answers a different
        question and always did.

        Reproduced in isolation against a COPY of that 261 MB journal (never the
        operator's store): the same 642-byte session's snapshot took 29 ms alone
        and **7909 ms** — the whole 7.9 s open — while the cold open ran, and
        exactly ONE request completed in that window. On this change the open
        takes 2453 ms and **24** requests complete inside it (median 70 ms, worst
        308 ms). See ``docs/evidence/session-load-central-cache``.

        ``session()`` hands out a RESIDENT bridge without re-checking the
        directory — that lookup is the expensive half of every read (see
        ``docs/evidence/session-load-central-cache``) — so a conversation this
        process had already opened kept answering ``sessions.get``, ``/history``
        and ``/mcp`` with 200 after its directory was deleted. Measured: the
        deleting daemon answered 200 where a FRESH one answered 404 for the same
        store, so a client that reloaded onto the removed id never saw the 404 its
        tombstone is written against. The delete is the only event that makes
        residency wrong, so it is the only caller.

        CLOSED AS WELL AS DROPPED, and the order matters: dropping the reference
        alone would leave the bridge's facade, subscribers and (after a watch
        beat) its lease running with nothing able to reach them — an orphan that
        this pool's own ``close()`` would no longer find, which is the leak this
        method exists to avoid as much as the wrong 200. The close is awaited
        AFTER the pool lock, because it takes the BRIDGE's lock and this pool's
        lock is held for frames only.

        The single-flight lookup is dropped with the bridge: a locate still in
        flight was started for a directory that is now gone, and leaving it in
