"""Full-fidelity remote session facade for a follower TUI (protocol v5).

``AttachedSession`` implements the same :class:`SessionProtocol` the standard
``OperatorApp`` already consumes. Durable history comes from the transcript;
live rendering comes from the owner's raw ``AgentEvent`` relay; every mutation
goes back over the authenticated loopback control socket. The app therefore
hosts its normal transcript, tool cards, composer, slash registry and gate
widgets. There is no attach-specific UI and no inverse-folding of the phone
projection.

Connection loss is plumbing, not a user decision. The facade silently
re-discovers a replacement owner or attempts the normal resume factory. The
existing sole-writer lease arbitrates simultaneous followers: one becomes the
owner, losers observe ``SessionLeaseHeldError`` and redial the winner. The app
installs a takeover callback at adoption so the winning real Session replaces
this facade without clearing the painted transcript.

#: User-facing refusal for a routed slash submitted while the owner is being
#: recovered. One string, formatted with the command, so every seam that can
#: race the gap says the same thing — never the transport's ``not attached``.
_RECONNECTING_SLASH_NOTICE = "session is reconnecting; try /{command} again in a moment"

#: The id :meth:`AttachedSession.queued_steering` substitutes when a wire item
#: carries none — an owner too old to put ``id`` on its queued-steer rows.
#:
#: EXPORTED rather than inlined because it is not an identity, and consumers
#: have to be able to say so. The TUI's Esc-recall matches the queue by id
#: (``OperatorApp._recall_queued_steers``), and this one value names EVERY
#: id-less entry — so a consumer that cannot tell the placeholder from a real
#: id could unsend one message while handing the composer another's text. A
#: hard-coded copy of the string on the far side is one rename away from
#: silently not matching, which is the same defect with no symptom.
UNIDENTIFIED_STEER_ID = "remote-steer"

#: The action receipts an ``AttachedSession`` client DECLARES in its attach auth
#: frame — the whole vocabulary, because every viewer on this facade renders the
#: receipt and submits its ``request`` itself (see the dial site below).
#:
#: A NAMED declaration rather than ``list(SLASH_ACTION_RECEIPTS)`` inlined at the
#: dial site, because the declaration is read in TWO directions and only one of
#: them is this file. The runtime reads it to decide whether to stand down
#: (``runtime_must_complete``), and the desktop route reads it to decide whether
#: the submit is ITS to make (``routes/desktop_sessions.py::
#: desktop_viewer_must_submit``). Inlining the same expression in one place left
#: the other reading the VOCABULARY instead, which made "did this client declare
#: it" a question with no possible answer but yes — the inert clause review round
#: 2 (NIT-1) measured. Read from here, a client kind that ever declares a SUBSET
#: narrows both sides together instead of double-submitting.
ATTACHED_SLASH_CONSUMERS: tuple[str, ...] = SLASH_ACTION_RECEIPTS

#: How long a VIEWER chases a vanished runtime before unbinding and going cold.
#: A runtime exits by design when it has nothing left to do, so owner loss is
#: usually not a crash at all — but a restart after a `kill -9` publishes a new
#: record within a second or two, so the window has to be wide enough to catch
#: that before concluding nothing is coming. Only the viewer path uses it; the
#: legacy attach path still recovers by taking over (see ``_can_go_cold``).
COLD_FALLBACK_S = 8.0

#: The budget a READ gives an existing owner to deliver canonical state before
#: the read serves the durable facade cold.
#:
#: A read is not an action a user is waiting on, which is why this is neither
#: ``FRONTEND_SYNC_FOREGROUND_S`` (15 s — the envelope for a command the user
#: just submitted) nor ``COLD_FALLBACK_S`` (8 s — the point at which a VIEWER
#: concludes owner loss and ends an in-flight turn locally with a named
#: ``owner-lost`` cut-off). Paying either on every panel open is exactly the
#: 15-17 s REFUSAL the read never needed: ``bridge.snapshot()``/``history()``
#: already serve the durable answer with no owner at all, in the same process,
#: on the same session directory. 2.0 s is the number this codebase already uses
#: for "one socket round trip plus the leg's own work" against a 15 s caller
#: deadline (``_ADMISSION_ACK_BOUND_S``, routes/desktop_sessions.py). A healthy
#: owner lands the welcome and the sync inside it by three orders of magnitude;
#: a stalled one does not, and the read does not care.
READ_ATTACH_BUDGET_S = 2.0

#: How long a desktop READ route waits for its (background) attach before it
#: answers from the durable facade.
#:
#: ``READ_ATTACH_BUDGET_S`` still bounds the ATTEMPT; this bounds only how much of
#: it the first paint pays. The attempt runs as a single-flight task on the
#: bridge (``DesktopSessionBridge.acquire``), so a read that outlives this grace
#: answers cold and the attach lands behind it as the rollover frame the renderer
#: already consumes. Before this split every snapshot/``/history``/``/events`` of a
#: busy owner paid the full 2 s (4 s when two reads serialised on the bridge lock,
#: and 17-20 s behind a control attach — measured with a SIGSTOPped runtime).
#:
#: 50 ms because a HEALTHY owner's attach is dial + sync + history cut, measured
#: at 17 ms p50 / 29 ms p95 on this fleet at load ~100, so a live owner still
#: paints its first frame live; and because the operator's budget for the whole
#: open is 300 ms, of which the snapshot's own encode is 10-40 ms.
READ_FIRST_FRAME_GRACE_S = 0.05

#: The whole envelope a DESKTOP CONTROL call (``/warm``, ``/messages``, every
#: control route) gives an EXISTING owner to welcome and sync before it is told
#: the runtime is busy.
#:
#: Not ``FRONTEND_SYNC_FOREGROUND_S``: that 15 s is the TUI's envelope for a user
#: watching a slash command in a terminal, and the TUI's own redial arithmetic
#: derives from it (``tui/app.py``), so it stays. The desktop renderer instead
#: cuts every control call at 20 s (``DESKTOP_CONTROL_DEADLINE_MS``) and, before
#: this, a live-but-silent owner consumed 15 s of that on the welcome alone and
#: then answered a generic 503 at 15.0-15.7 s. A healthy owner welcomes and syncs
#: in tens of milliseconds, so 3 s only ever expires against an owner whose loop
#: is genuinely not answering — and the answer it produces is the typed
#: ``RuntimeUnresponsiveError``, which the route turns into a RETRYABLE
#: ``runtime_busy`` refusal. Retrying is safe: admissions are at-most-once by the
#: receipt journal, keyed by the client's request id.
#:
#: Scoped to ``surface == "desktop"`` (see ``_foreground_envelope``); every other
#: surface keeps the historical envelope.
DESKTOP_CONTROL_ATTACH_S = 3.0

#: How long a read's RETAINED dial may wait for its canonical sync before the
#: socket is abandoned.
#:
#: :meth:`AttachedSession._retain_unsynced_dial` keeps an authenticated-but-
#: unsynced dial alive so a sync that lands after the read's budget still
#: installs state and publishes the rollover the renderer already handles. It
#: cannot be kept indefinitely: an attach socket is a residency term of the
#: runtime's own exit predicate (see the conditions below), so a viewer that
#: has given up must stop holding an 82 MB process resident. This is the hard
#: deadline after which the client is closed and the runtime's attach slot is
#: given back. That slot is a residency term only FOR A VISIBLE PANEL, which is
#: worth stating because it is narrower than "an attach socket":
#: ``runtime.server.attach_clients`` counts a ``kind == "attach"`` client and
#: then, for a desktop surface, only while its lease is live AND
#: ``desktop_visible or desktop_can_notify``. So a retained dial from a visible
#: panel pins the runtime — the case this deadline exists for — and one from a
#: background read holds nothing (while still occupying an ``ATTACH_MAX_CLIENTS``
#: slot). The deadline is right either way; the sentence is narrower than it read.
SYNC_LANDING_DEADLINE_S = 30.0

#: How long the DIAL path waits for a desktop presence re-assert's ack.
#:
#: Best-effort, exactly like the event-mute re-assert five lines above it on the
#: same path: the presence lease's own TTL (``DESKTOP_WATCH_LEASE_S``, 45 s) and
#: the renderer's next 15 s beat repair a lost assertion, and a READ must not be
#: refused because a presence hint went unacknowledged. Bounded so a wedged
#: owner cannot hold a redial open for the full ``ACK_TIMEOUT_S`` (15 s) over an
#: optimisation. A caller that brought a deadline of its own (a read) clamps
#: this further — see ``_dial``.
_DESKTOP_WATCH_ACK_BOUND_S = 5.0

#: The SECOND bound on recovery used to live here: ``RECOVERY_GIVE_UP_S = 2 *
#: HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_S`` (90 s), for the LIVE-BUT-SILENT owner — a record is
#: found on every pass, the socket accepts, the canonical sync never lands.
#:
#: DELETED, and the reason matters: it was one bound too many, and it bounded
#: the wrong thing. Whatever the registry would eventually conclude about that
#: owner, the VIEWER has already concluded it at ``COLD_FALLBACK_S`` — that is
#: where the in-flight turn is ended locally with a named ``owner-lost``
#: cut-off. What the 90 s then bought was 82 more seconds of ``_recovering``,
#: which REFUSES ``/model``, ``/goal``, ``/rename``, ``/effort``, ``/compact``,
#: ``/fork`` and ``/credential`` with ``_RECONNECTING_SLASH_NOTICE`` and PARKS
#: ``prompt`` silently on ``_runtime_ready`` with no message, no spinner
#: resolution and no advice. Measured with a discoverable-but-silent owner: the
#: verdict landed at t+8.1 s, the user typed at t+8.6 s, and the message was
#: served at t+50.4 s — 41.75 s of ``streaming=True, recovering=True`` and
#: nothing on screen (UX round 1, U2).
#:
#: What it did NOT buy was the chase. The exit is COLD AND REBINDABLE rather
#: than failed (``_give_up_recovery`` sets ``_can_go_cold`` before ``_go_cold``:
#: the transcript stays, ``_runtime_ready`` is set, and the next action
#: re-engages through ``_ensure_bound`` against that very same record), so a
#: released caller re-dials what the loop was dialing, and a released prompt is
#: served or reports its failure instead of parking. Nor can the early release
#: double-bind or double-spawn: ``engage_runtime`` short-circuits on a
#: discoverable record and otherwise waits rather than spawning while a live pid
#: holds the lease.
#:
#: So the rule is now ONE rule for every arm that has not produced a usable
#: runtime — no-record and record-seen alike — and it is the cold window that a
#: runtime restarting after ``kill -9`` has to republish in anyway. A successor
#: that IS coming is still caught: the loop reattaches the moment a record it
#: can use appears, and the give-up's own rebind catches a slower one.

#: Backoff ceiling for ``_recover_runtime``'s DIAL-FAILURE arm specifically.
#:
#: That arm ``continue``s, which skips the sleep at the bottom of the loop, so
#: its own ``sleep(delay)`` is the only pacing on the path — the ceiling has to
#: move here and nowhere else. It matters for the FAST-FAILURE owner shape (a
#: socket that accepts and then rejects the welcome), measured at 2.33 accepted
#: connections/second. Against ``ATTACH_MAX_CLIENTS`` with LRU eviction that is
#: a real cascade: every slot this loop takes evicts a legitimate client, the
#: prior art being the 272-eviction burst documented on
#: ``_discard_rejected_client``. 2.0 s cuts the worst-case slot-take rate ~4x
#: while keeping the first four retries inside ~1 s, which is the window a
#: runtime restarting after ``kill -9`` actually republishes in.
#:
#: DELIBERATELY DIVERGED from ``_BIND_RETRY_DELAY_CAP_S``, whose comment says
#: the two backoff shapes were copied from each other on purpose. They are no
#: longer the same shape and must not be re-unified: ``_bind_under_lock`` is
#: bounded to ``_BIND_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`` inside a wall-clock budget, so it cannot
#: storm and a longer cap there would only add latency a user sits through.
#: This loop is bounded in wall-clock but not in attempts, so its ceiling is
#: what limits the rate.
_RECOVERY_DIAL_CAP_S = 2.0

#: Loop turns granted after a sync wall-clock expiry BEFORE the expiry is
#: believed. This is the load-bearing half of the fix for the false timeout,
#: and it is a turn count rather than a duration on purpose.
#:
#: ``asyncio.wait_for`` compares against a WALL clock, so if the VIEWER's own
#: loop is blocked past the deadline — a Textual repaint, a GC pause, or plain
#: CPU starvation — the timeout fires on the next turn regardless of whether
#: the frame already arrived on the socket. Reproduced against a deliberately
#: fast owner: frame written at 0.30 s, deadline 1.0 s, ``TimeoutError`` raised
#: with ``future.done() is False``, and 0.05 s later ``future.done() is True``.
#: The viewer blamed the owner for its own stall, discarded a healthy
#: connection, and the TUI printed a boot failure.
#:
#: Resolution after such an expiry costs exactly THREE bare turns (6/6 trials):
#: the pump task has to be scheduled, read the buffered line, and resolve the
#: future. 16 is ~5x that headroom. Per ``AGENTS.md`` ("bound by loop turns
#: rather than seconds — a turn count survives contention that a wall-clock
#: budget does not") this number does not need calibrating against a machine,
#: which is precisely why it is expressed in turns.
FRONTEND_SYNC_SETTLE_TURNS = 16

#: Catastrophe backstop for the canonical sync on a BACKGROUND bind (the TUI's
#: speculative mount/keystroke engage, owner recovery, the desktop proxy).
#: NOT a calibrated bound on how long a healthy owner takes — liveness decides
#: that, and every genuine failure resolves through the pump in milliseconds
#: (``_dial``'s ``on_disconnected`` fails the future with the socket's own
#: reason). This exists only so a viewer whose socket is alive but whose owner
#: will never speak fails instead of hanging forever; ``#401`` is the standing
#: reminder that a wedged loop is a real failure mode here, and ``AGENTS.md``'s
#: ``DEADLOCK_GUARD_S`` is the shape.
#:
#: Generous because nothing correct depends on its value and nobody is waiting:
#: it has to clear the 15 s-vs-45 s window in which a record still reads
#: ``live`` (``HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_S``) while the authoritative loop that would
#: write both the heartbeat and the sync is occupied by a turn. A 16 s stall in
#: that window reproduced the operator's exact sentence at socket level.
FRONTEND_SYNC_BACKSTOP_S = 120.0

#: The same backstop for a FOREGROUND bind — a user is watching a specific
#: command and the budgets COMPOSE, so the generous envelope must not reach
#: them. Today's worst foreground path is 30 s engage + 15 s welcome ack +
#: 15 s sync = 60 s; keeping the per-attempt sync envelope at the historical
#: 15 s and capping the whole retry loop (``_FOREGROUND_BIND_BUDGET_S``) holds
#: that at or below what it already is. A foreground caller that exhausts it
#: is not told the session failed — the runtime is alive in the background and
#: the next keystroke rejoins it.
FRONTEND_SYNC_FOREGROUND_S = 15.0

#: The envelope for a wait that BLOCKS the facade while it runs. Today that is
#: ``_recover_runtime``, whose ``_recovering`` flag refuses prompts, `/fork`,
#: `/model` and every other mutation for as long as the wait lasts, and which
#: is itself bounded by ``COLD_FALLBACK_S`` — going cold is its designed,
#: non-failing outcome, after which the next prompt re-engages through
#: ``_ensure_bound`` (with the retry below) against the very same record.
#:
#: This DIVERGES from the design note, which grouped recovery with the silent
#: background binds. Recovery is not silent: a 120 s wait here would hold the
#: whole TUI in "session is reconnecting" for two minutes AND would starve the
#: recovery loop's own cold deadline, which is checked once per pass. A short
#: envelope loses nothing, because the fallback is a cold viewer that rebinds
#: on the next keystroke rather than a lost session.
FRONTEND_SYNC_BLOCKED_S = 15.0

#: Total wall-clock a bind may spend across ALL its retry attempts, per
#: envelope. It bounds the whole loop rather than each attempt, so three
#: attempts cannot triple the wait a user sits through.
#:
#: The foreground budget is deliberately EQUAL to the single-attempt envelope,
#: which means this change adds no worst-case foreground wait at all: 15 s was
#: what a user could already sit through before it, with no retry and a boot
#: failure at the end. Retries fit inside that budget rather than extending it.
#:
#: That works because retrying only ever helps a FAST failure — a refused dial,
#: a socket that died in milliseconds, a record that moved — and those return
#: with the budget almost untouched, leaving the next attempt a full envelope.
#: The one case a retry cannot help is a genuinely silent owner, which is also
#: the only case that consumes the envelope; a second attempt there would ask
#: the same busy loop the same question and wait the same 15 s for it. So
#: spending more than one envelope on the foreground path buys nothing and
#: costs the user real time.
#:
#: A measured worst case, against an owner that accepts and never syncs:
#: 25.0 s over 2 attempts under an earlier 25 s budget, versus 15 s pre-fix.
#: That was a regression on exactly the path the change exists to improve.
_FOREGROUND_BIND_BUDGET_S = FRONTEND_SYNC_FOREGROUND_S
_BACKGROUND_BIND_BUDGET_S = FRONTEND_SYNC_BACKSTOP_S

#: Splitting the two envelopes is only half the guarantee. The other half is
#: ``_bind_lock``: every ``_ensure_bound`` contends for it, so a foreground
#: caller that arrives while a BACKGROUND bind holds it inherits that bind's
#: budget before it ever reaches its own. ``is_cold`` stays True for the whole
#: background bind (``_client`` is installed only after the sync), so the
#: pre-lock guard does not stop it either.
#:
#: That is the ordinary TUI startup sequence, not a corner: the mount engage
#: runs ``foreground=False`` and the user's first prompt is a foreground bind
#: arriving while it is in flight. Measured on the branch before this constant
#: existed: a foreground caller waited 134.5 s against 29.5 s pre-fix, linear
#: in the background envelope (5 s backstop -> 19.7 s, 15 -> 29.7, 30 -> 44.7,
#: 60 -> 74.7). Design §5.3 names that 165 s composition and forbids it.
#:
#: The mechanism is PREEMPTION, not a second timeout. A foreground arrival
#: publishes itself on ``_foreground_waiting`` and the in-flight background
#: bind cuts its remaining budget to this value and finishes or fails inside
#: it.
#:
#: WHAT THE YIELD COVERS. Both places a background bind can spend real time
#: while holding the lock, which is the whole of it:
#:
#: * the ENGAGE (``engage_runtime``, bounded by its own
#:   ``DEFAULT_DEADLINE_S = 30 s``), which takes this event and
#:   ``_BACKGROUND_YIELD_BUDGET_S`` as its own preemption pair; and
#: * the SYNC WAIT and its retry backoff, through ``_effective_deadline``.
#:
#: The engage half was added in review round 2 (MAJOR-1): before it, ``preempt``
#: was not computed until after the engage had returned, so a foreground caller
#: arriving during the spawn/discovery phase published on a counter nothing was
#: reading yet and inherited ``DEFAULT_DEADLINE_S`` — measured at 15.83 s
#: against an 8 s stalled engage. The advertised bound and the real one now
#: agree; do not narrow one without narrowing the other.
#:
#: Two reasons it is preemption rather than ``wait_for(lock.acquire())``:
#:
#: * Bounding acquisition alone leaves the foreground caller giving up on the
#:   lock and then having nothing to do — it cannot dial itself without
#:   reintroducing the two-engages-racing-for-one-lease bug the lock exists to
#:   prevent, and a second runtime spawned for one session is far worse than a
#:   slow bind.
#: * The background bind's work is the SAME work the foreground caller wants.
#:   Yielding the lock would throw away a dial that is already authenticated;
#:   shortening it keeps it, and if it lands the foreground caller finds the
#:   facade warm at the ``is_cold`` re-check and returns immediately.
#:
#: Sized as the backoff the background bind is allowed to keep spending once
#: someone is watching: short enough that the foreground caller's total wait
#: stays inside its own envelope's order of magnitude, long enough that a dial
#: already mid-sync gets a real chance to land rather than being discarded a
#: moment before it would have succeeded.
_BACKGROUND_YIELD_BUDGET_S = 1.0

#: Shown to the USER verbatim: the TUI relays a refused bind's text straight
#: into a notice, so this is product copy rather than an internal diagnostic.
#: It therefore names no runtime vocabulary ("owner"), and ends in the same
#: next step every sibling refusal on this seam offers, because a refusal the
#: reader cannot act on reads as a dead end (design D1, UX U1).
_MODEL_INTENT_PENDING = (
    "still starting this conversation on the model you asked for; " "try that again in a moment"
)

#: Bounded retry of the INITIAL bind. A first attempt that loses its race with
#: a retiring runtime, or that hits an owner whose loop is momentarily busy, is
#: a transient — the owner is typically answering seconds later, and before
#: this the viewer surrendered on the first ``ConnectionError`` and left the
#: session cold with a boot-failure notice. Deliberately small: the retry is
#: for a transient, not a substitute for the backstop above.
#:
#: Safe because ``_bind_to``'s failure path already calls
#: ``_discard_rejected_client`` (see its docstring for the half-bound facade
#: and the 272-eviction burst that discipline exists to prevent), so every
#: attempt starts from a clean facade and no attach slot leaks against
#: ``ATTACH_MAX_CLIENTS``. ``find_runtime_record`` is re-run per attempt so a
#: runtime that retired and respawned between attempts is picked up rather
#: than redialled at its dead pid. The backoff shape was originally copied from
#: ``_recover_runtime`` so the two redial loops behaved the same way; the CEILINGS
#: have since deliberately diverged (``_RECOVERY_DIAL_CAP_S`` is 2.0 s) and this
#: one is deliberately LEFT at 0.5. This loop is bounded to
#: ``_BIND_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`` inside a wall-clock budget, so it cannot storm attach
#: slots the way an attempt-unbounded loop can, and a longer cap here would only
#: add latency to a bind a caller is waiting on. Do not re-unify them.
_BIND_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
_BIND_RETRY_INITIAL_S = 0.1
_BIND_RETRY_FACTOR = 1.7
_BIND_RETRY_DELAY_CAP_S = 0.5

#: Backoff for RETRYING the canonical re-sync a degraded delta owes, when that
#: re-sync fails against a socket that is still up (the owner busy, a transient
#: RPC error). Retrying is not optional bookkeeping: the degraded frame consumed
#: a sequence, so the follower's gap check stays satisfied forever while its
#: canonical fields are missing whatever that frame carried. Giving up after one
#: attempt leaves a LIVE connection showing WRONG data with nothing on screen
#: saying so — strictly worse than a dropped one, which at least re-syncs on
#: reconnect.
#:
#: Retries continue while the socket is alive rather than stopping at a fixed
#: attempt count, because the debt does not expire: nothing else on a non-TUI
#: follower (``cli.py``, ``session_factory.py``, the desktop bridge) ever calls
#: ``ensure_display_current`` to notice. The CAP is what keeps that from being a
#: storm — a persistently failing owner is retried once per
#: ``_DEGRADED_RESYNC_RETRY_CAP_S``, not in a tight loop — and a dead or swapped
#: client ends it outright, since a reconnect re-syncs from scratch.
#:
#: The initial delay is deliberately not zero: the common cause of a failed pass
#: is an owner too busy to answer (the nine-subagent session that produced the

#: overloaded loop the same question.

    THE QUESTION IS THE VALUE RULE the band itself applies
    (``usage_seed.denominator_window``): does this spec carry a window the band can
    DIVIDE BY, i.e. one that is not ``UNKNOWN_CONTEXT_WINDOW`` (128k)? That is the
    same question, asked of the same spec, so the window the first frame
    restores and the window the band refuses cannot disagree.

    WHY NOT ``default_context_window``/``max_context_window``, which is what this
    predicate used to read: those two fields are PROVIDER PROVENANCE, not the
    answer. The shipped catalogue states a window through ``context_window``
    alone — 0 of its 120 rows set either provenance field — so reading them as
    "did the model layer answer?" reported "nothing answered" for every pair
    whose resolution carries no provenance, and the checkpoint's window was
    restored under a fresher one. Measured on the population that needs no
    history at all, a Codex/OAuth-served conversation resumed on an OpenAI API
    key (the fresh spec's only budget is the row's 1,050,000, which
    ``denominator_window`` VOUCHES, so it is a budget and not the placeholder):
    cold ``110.3%/272k`` where the attach frame paints ``28.6%/1.1M`` (review
    round 3, blocker 1). The narrowed predicate is also why the mirror direction
    looked safe: an OAuth opt-out DOES resolve provenance fields, so the
    one-directional hole was easy to miss.

    THE ONE CARVE-OUT IS THE LOCAL ROUTES, and its signal is the PROVIDER KIND:
    ``LOCAL_PROVIDER_IDS`` is exactly the set ``build_model_spec`` routes to
    ``local_model_spec``, whose fallback window its own docstring calls "a
    conservative working budget, not a claim about the model" — a route FILL
    rather than an answer, so a vouched window there is not evidence that the
    model layer answered. What that builder does record is the SERVER'S OWN
    evidence, in ``default_context_window``/``max_context_window``, and nothing
    else — so on these routes those two fields are the discrimination, and their
    absence means the window is the client-side fill. An uncovered local tag's
    4,096 (``DEFAULT_LOCAL_CONTEXT``) must therefore not displace a checkpoint's
    32,768, or the first frame paints ``488.2%/4k`` for a 20,000-token reading
    (review round 1, minor 1).

    Keyed on the constant the BUILDER routes on rather than on a spelling of one
    route or a magic value (``context_window == 4,096``), because a fill and a
    real answer leave the same fields behind — there is no spec-level provenance
    flag to ask, which is the model-layer gap design round 2's D2 defers. Keyed
    on the same constant, the two cannot drift.

    ONE SOURCE PER FRAME. Both readers of the gate ask THIS function — the
    state-level window (``_consistent_context``) and the spec-level one
    (``_restored_model_specs``) — so a frame can never divide by the fresh spec's
    window while its spec still carries the checkpoint's, or the reverse. The
    numerator is the conversation's own reading on either side of the branch,
    because that is the pair the attaching runtime publishes
    (``frontend_state.refresh_from_session``: ``receipt_context or
    current.context_tokens`` beside the EFFECTIVE spec's own window), and this is
    the frame that has to agree with it.

        wire to the runtime, while this is purely local — see ``_dial``).
        False, the default, is the legacy attach contract: owner loss is
        recovered by TAKING OVER the conversation, and a facade built this way
        returns from ``_ensure_bound`` without dialling (``_can_go_cold`` is
        False on it) unless recovery is releasing it. False does not BY ITSELF
        imply the flag is unset, though: this keyword adds the capability, and
        ``__init__`` sets it independently for ``surface="desktop"``. No caller
        passes both today (no ``connect`` caller passes ``surface`` at all), so
        the two are disjoint — but they are separate switches, and a future
        ``connect(..., surface="desktop", viewer=False)`` would still be a
        viewer, which is the asymmetry to keep in mind rather than a
        contradiction to resolve here.

        True builds the VIEWER contract instead — the same one ``cold`` and
        ``saved_preview`` set, and the only one this keyword asks for: owner
        loss may end with the facade UNBOUND (``_go_cold``), which it reports
        as ``is_cold`` while keeping the transcript on screen, and the next
        action rebinds it through ``_ensure_bound``. That is set by
        ``_can_go_cold`` and it is what makes a cold facade actively
        REBINDABLE: ``_ensure_bound``'s first guard returns immediately while
        the flag is False, so a facade that lost its owner WITHOUT the flag can
        never bind again — the silent no-op that turned a routine drop into a
        permanent "Reconnect failed".

        WHY THE CALLERS DIFFER, which is the whole point of this parameter.
        ``/resume`` (and the startup attach, and ``lop --resume``) must keep the
        legacy contract: those callers exist to put the user in FRONT of the
        conversation, so recovering it into this process is the correct end. A
        SIDEBAR lease is the opposite: a parked, delta-muted source nobody is
        looking at (see ``_lease_sidebar_source``), whose takeover factory
        raises by construction, so "recover" would mean owning a conversation
        the user has not chosen — and whose loss is therefore an ordinary event
        to be healed on the click, not a failure to report.

        runtime wrote a full ``FrontendSessionState`` to the transcript at every
        turn end (``FrontendStateStore.checkpoint``), and that row already holds
        the subagent roster, the todo list, the conversation title, the goal WITH
        its judged record (status, live judge, settled history) and the
        accumulated spend.

        Before this, none of it was read: a resumed session opened with an empty
        subagent panel and no todos, and stayed that way until the user sent a
        message and a runtime started. The old in-process TUI restored exactly
        this state at boot (``Session.__init__`` calls ``_load_subagent_roster``
        and ``_load_todo_snapshot``), so the viewer model regressed it — the
        details were not slow to arrive, they were never going to arrive.

        The checkpoint is authoritative for what it carries and the synthesised
        state is authoritative for the rest, so the two are merged rather than

        (using the shared conversation-selection reader, not mutable defaults),

        ``jobs`` are stamped ``restored`` for the same reason the session's own
        restore does — a restored row has no in-process trajectory, and the panel
        says so rather than rendering a busy child as empty.

        """Fill still-null accounting from the conversation's own receipts.

        The cold path's second source, AFTER the durable checkpoint, and it
        exists because the checkpoint is usually absent on this surface: the
        runtime writes one only with a frontend attached at turn end
        (``FrontendStateStore.checkpoint``), while a desktop detaches between
        requests. So a conversation reopened cold opened with an empty context
        and no spend — for a session that might be deep into its window with
        dollars already on it — until the user spent a whole turn. The transcript
        holds those readings; ``_cold_seed_usage`` is the one the suffix read
        stashed (``_read_transcript._replay``).

        For MONEY the order is: WHICHEVER of the checkpoint's accumulator and the
        durable ``session_spend.v1`` record is NEWER in the journal (their own
        order, from the same suffix read — see ``_cold_record_is_newer``), then
        the one-receipt floor. The record exists precisely so a cold surface does
        not have to reconstruct a total from a point-in-time reading — and it is
        durable without a UI attached, which is the property the checkpoint lacks
        (design §2.3, R5) — but it is written per CALL while the checkpoint is
        written per TURN END, so either can be the newer, and only the journal can
        say which (QA round 1, Q2).

        FILLS ONLY, field by field, for every field EXCEPT the money, which the
        ordering above may OVERRIDE: a checkpoint that carried accounting is the
        conversation's last turn-end state, and a record that outlived it is
        newer still. When the two disagree and no order can be established, the
        figure is kept but demoted to a lower bound rather than certified. EVERY write below
        is therefore gated on its own target field still being unset — including
        the window, which is the one that must not be imported under a stored
        numerator (a checkpoint at 500_000/1_050_000 read as 390.6% of a fresh
        128k denominator, with the checkpoint's tokens).

        * ``last_usage`` — the raw receipt, whenever there is one.
        * ``context_tokens`` — only when the reading can be attributed to the
          model that will RUN (``reading_identity`` against the effective spec),
          which is the same gate ``_consistent_context`` applies to a checkpoint
          reading. A count measured on another model is not convertible.
        * ``context_window`` — from ``reading_window`` when the receipt can be
          attributed to this model, else straight from ``denominator_window(spec)``.
          Both ask the SAME value question (is this a budget or the placeholder),
          and they differ only in the question ``reading_window`` adds on top of it:
          whether the reading is ATTRIBUTABLE (a receipt for another model is not
          this model's reading). A spec's own window is a fact about the model
          regardless of who measured anything against it, and it is what the band
          divides by on every later paint, so it is written either way (review
          round 2, minor 1). The resolved flag alone is NOT evidence, because
          ``UNKNOWN_CONTEXT_WINDOW`` (128_000) is written together with that flag
          whenever account metadata could not be resolved — which is why the value
          rule, not the flag, is the one both callers share. With no window at all
          the strip renders its honest ``window unknown`` state — absolute tokens,
          no arc.
        * ``cumulative_parent_cost`` with ``cost_knowledge=FLOOR`` — priced on the
          receipt's own serving identity (a receipt from another model was billed
          at THAT model's rates), and only when the receipt is attributable at
          all. Priced from ONE receipt, so it UNDERSTATES lifetime spend on a long
          conversation: that is what ``floor`` means on the wire and the cost chip
          already prints the mark. An unpriceable model yields ``None`` and no
          chip rather than ``$0.0000``.

        Nothing here touches the wire shape: this fills INPUTS the strip already
        reads, and ``cumulative_cost`` stays a derived property. There is no
        ``refresh_frontend_usage`` on a viewer — the seed happens at open.

        written, the stored numerator and the current denominator describe
        different things, and dividing one by the other produces a confident

        measured context and the resolved name consistent with each other.

        The synthesised cold spec is built from ``config.yml`` and the journal,
        which name the provider and model — and, since this process resolves the
        pair through the catalogue (``cold_model.resolve_saved_model``), whatever
        metadata this machine can read OFFLINE. Where that is not enough, the
        restored state is: the session's last runtime wrote a full spec into its
        checkpoint, and the values the conversation's own history was actually
        measured and named against are there.

        The WINDOW is the case this rule was written for. The restored
        ``context_tokens`` were measured against the window the runtime actually
        had (1M on the reference session), so dividing 322,546 by a placeholder
        window is how a resumed session painted **268.2%** (design review round
        1, D1) — a number that cannot be true, on the one surface that exists to
        tell the user how much room is left. The checkpoint's own spec is the one
        those tokens were measured against, so it is the honest denominator.

        Taken on the SAME-MODEL gate the numerator is taken on
        (``_restored_pair``), which decides WHICH MODEL the reading belongs to —
        not, as an earlier revision of this docstring had it, that the pair then
        always travels together. WHICH WINDOW the restored numerator meets is a
        separate question (``_fresh_spec_states_a_budget``), and the answer is
        not the checkpoint's wherever this process resolved a budget of its own.
        That asymmetry is deliberate and it is the one the runtime's own attach
        frame already follows — ``frontend_state.refresh_from_session`` pairs
        ``receipt_context or current.context_tokens`` with the EFFECTIVE spec's
        window — because the band's percentage predicts when the NEXT request
        overflows, so a restored numerator under a stale denominator misstates
        the one number this surface exists to report.

        The checkpoint's window is the wrong answer wherever the fresh spec has
        one. Measured on this branch while the gate was absent: a conversation
        whose account GREW from 272k to 872k first-painted ``110.3%/272k``
        against the live frame's ``34.4%/872k`` (usage overstated threefold), and
        one whose account opted OUT of the maximum first-painted ``45.9%/872k``
        against the live ``147.1%/272k`` — a calm reading that HIDES an
        over-budget conversation on the one surface that exists to warn about it
        (review round 2, blocker 1; design round 2, D1).

        The populations it must KEEP adopting for, because the fresh spec states
        no answer there and the checkpoint's window is the only real number in
        the process: an unresolved account (the 128k placeholder, neither
        ``default`` nor ``max`` set) and an uncovered local tag (the 4,096 route
        default, the same two fields absent). Those are the reported
        ``224.6%/128k`` and review round 1's ``488.2%/4k``.

        The NAME rides the same-model gate for its own reason — it is a fact
        about THIS model that only a runtime which ran it could resolve — and it
        is taken on naming's own rule (``naming.resolved_a_name``,
        ``_naming_resolved_no_name``) rather than a copy of one of that rule's

        ``is_cold`` is the other half and is NOT the same fact: while a client is
        connected and synced this pane can still POST the answer, so a stop it

        so a session that is stopped and later restarted or resumed by ANYONE,
        and which this viewer then binds to, has the term false again before its
        next card is offered. A stop ends the TURN, and the parked gate with it
        (which is why refusing is honest); it does not end the session. The
        reconcile that re-arms is level-triggered off the successor's own
        frontend delta, so nothing has to remember to lift this by hand.

        WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, because the absence is not evidence: an owner killed
        WITHOUT an announcement (kill -9, OOM) leaves no ``stopping`` frame and —
        for a session with no wake schedules — no ``stopped_at`` marker either
        (``session_was_stopped`` documents both limits). Such a pane is
        indistinguishable here from one whose LIVE owner is simply stalled, and
        the second kind can still deliver its answer, so both keep the card.
        Closing that arm needs a fact this predicate cannot read synchronously:
        that no pid holds the lease at all (``cold_reason == "no-runtime"``,
        classified only by a read).

        NOT simply "does ``_ensure_bound``'s first guard return": it demands an
        owner that is actually unreachable, and two of the three reasons
        ``is_cold`` can be true are excluded by the terms below.

        ``_recovering`` is the first exclusion: a facade with a recovery loop
        RUNNING is on its way back, so it answers True even on the legacy
        contract where the flag that guard reads is still unset. Every exit of
        that loop either attaches this facade or releases it rebindable
        (``_give_up_recovery`` sets ``_can_go_cold`` before it goes cold), so no
        arm of it ends more closed than it started.

        The second exclusion is a CONNECTED CLIENT, and it is not the same
        fact: ``is_cold`` is also true while ``_refresh_display_history``
        rebuilds the window with the socket UP and the runtime still serving
        (``_ready_for_events`` is its third disjunct, and ``/move``'s seam in
        this file grades the same conflation MAJOR). Such a facade is cold,
        un-diallable — and perfectly alive, on its way to a sync that completes on
        its own, so a caller that read the guard's two flags alone would report
        a live session as gone and skip the round that waits the refresh out.

        THE REACHABLE False IS A DELIBERATE STOP ON THE LEGACY CONTRACT, and it
        is worth stating here because nothing else in this file says it plainly:
        ``connect`` without ``viewer=True`` builds ``_can_go_cold = False``, and
        ``_on_disconnected``'s deliberate-stop branch returns BEFORE setting
        ``_recovering`` or starting ``_recover_runtime`` — so there is no loop,
        nothing sets the flag, no client is left connected, and the facade is
        cold and closed to dialling for the rest of the process's life. Two
        routes reach it, both with the honest sentence already painted on that
        screen: this viewer's own ``/stop``, and a stop someone ELSE issued
        (``lop stop``, another terminal's ``/stop all``) that
        ``_recover_runtime`` discovers from the wake marker. ``lop --resume``
        leaves exactly that facade behind, and the TUI registers it as a sidebar
        source. The disposed arm is latent by comparison: every ``dispose()``
        reachable from a sidebar source retires the source first or is app
        shutdown.

        Desktop read/subscription requests use the cold viewer's recovery policy
        even when an owner is already live: losing that owner must never move
        execution into the HTTP worker or start a replacement just for a reader.

        ``budget`` selects READ MODE. A read has no use for an owner's answer
        delivered after the user has already lost interest, and it has a durable
        answer of its own — the transcript the cold facade parses
        (``AttachedSession.cold``) — so it gives the owner ``budget`` seconds to
        deliver canonical state and then serves cold. Two properties follow from
        that, and they are the contract rather than a side effect:

        * **A read never raises for a session that exists on disk.** This is the
          whole of the reported failure: the route ladder converted
          ``OwnerAckTimeout`` out of a silent-but-alive owner into
          ``503 Session owner is unavailable`` after ~17 s, when the durable rows
          had been readable in 0.02 s the entire time. In read mode the attempt
          is bounded and every failure below the caller is absorbed here.
        * **The dial is RETAINED, not discarded.** A read that ran out of budget
          leaves its authenticated socket open so the sync that lands a moment
          later still installs state and publishes the rollover the renderer
          already handles (see :meth:`_retain_unsynced_dial`) — bounded by
          ``SYNC_LANDING_DEADLINE_S`` so a viewer that has given up cannot pin a
          runtime resident.

        ``None`` (the default) is the CONTROL envelope every existing caller
        keeps: one attempt on the foreground envelope, and a raise when the
        owner does not serve it.

        ``control_budget`` narrows that CONTROL attempt to a DEADLINE over the
        whole dial + sync, for the desktop's control routes
        (``DESKTOP_CONTROL_ATTACH_S``). An owner that accepts the socket and
        never welcomes — the SIGSTOPped/busy shape — used to hold the request
        for ``ACK_TIMEOUT_S`` (15 s) on the welcome alone; the deadline covers
        the welcome too, and an expiry is raised as the typed
        :class:`RuntimeUnresponsiveError` (the runtime is alive and busy), which
        the route answers as a retryable ``runtime_busy``. Ignored in read mode.

        The return value is the same question in both modes — is this facade
        attached — so a read that served cold answers ``False`` while leaving the
        retained dial in place (``attaching``), which is what the bridge's

        the way to a 503. It is now bounded by ``timeout`` (defaulting to

        reason that bound exists: a wedged owner must not hold a beat — or a
        redial — open for the full request timeout over an optimisation.
        ``timeout`` is the CALLER's clamp, so a read passes what is left of its

        BEFORE calling, so a bad path costs the user one line and never a
        half-applied state. Validating again here would put the user-facing
        sentences in two places, which is how they drift (QA Q6).

        THE CWD IS BAKED IN AT SPAWN. ``_spawn_runtime`` passes it as
        ``LOP_MOBILE_CHILD_CWD`` and the child reads it once in ``amain``,
        which is then the session's ``_cwd`` for the rest of that runtime's
        life — it reaches the system prompt's environment block, every tool
        call's ``ToolContext.cwd``, skill discovery and MCP config resolution.
        There is no live setter to call and adding one would be wrong: those
        consumers read the value at different moments, so a mid-flight change
        would leave one turn's prompt disagreeing with the tools that turn
        actually ran.

        So the honest implementations are exactly two, and which one applies is
        a property of the viewer rather than a choice:

        * COLD — no runtime yet. The directory is simply the one the next
          engage will spawn with, so this is a field assignment and costs
          nothing. This is the "at the start of a session" case, and it is the
          common one: ``lop`` opens cold.
        * BOUND — a runtime is already serving. It is retired and a fresh one
          is engaged at the new directory. That is a REBIND, not a new
          conversation: the session id, the transcript and everything on screen
          are untouched, and the successor replays the same durable history the
          predecessor wrote. It is the same shape as the build-refresh path
          (``_go_cold(refresh=True)`` → re-engage), which exists precisely
          because retiring an idle runtime and starting its successor is a
          housekeeping event rather than an ending.

        A BUSY runtime is REFUSED rather than rebuilt. Retiring mid-turn would
        abort a model call the user is paying for and did not ask to lose, and
        "apply it to the next turn" is the option that produces exactly the
        divergence AGENTS.md calls out for ``/reload``: the band would show the
        new directory while the running turn's tools still resolve against the
        old one. Refusing states the situation and leaves both surfaces
        agreeing.

        It leaves by the RETIRING route (``retire_now``), never the stopping
        one, and that distinction is the whole correctness argument for the
        bound path. ``stop`` announces ``stopping``, which latches
        ``_deliberate_stop`` in ``_on_disconnected`` and parks this viewer in
        the stopped state — the right answer for a session the user ENDED and
        the wrong one for a move, which ends a runtime while the conversation
        continues. ``retiring`` already means "a successor is owed; engage
        one": it goes cold with ``refresh=True`` and fires the refresh callback
        the app re-engages on. So a move reuses the mechanism the build refresh
        established rather than issuing a stop and then trying to un-latch it —
        which cannot work anyway, since the disconnect that sets the flag
        arrives AFTER this method's ack has returned.

        The move is applied to ``_cwd`` FIRST and only then is the runtime
        asked to go, so the successor cannot be engaged before the field it
        reads is set. If the retire is refused the field is put back: a viewer
        whose ``_cwd`` says one thing while its runtime works in another is
        precisely the divergence this method exists to avoid.

        DURING OWNER RECOVERY it refuses, in the same words and for the same
        reason as ``route_shared_slash`` one seam over. A recovering viewer is
        chasing a successor that ``_recover_runtime`` will bind at whatever cwd
        the owner's record names, so a "cold move" reported here is silently
        undone the moment that bind lands — the viewer would say it moved and
        then work somewhere else, which is the one divergence this method
        exists to prevent. Refusing keeps the whole seam consistent: every
        request/response operation on this class (routed slash, compaction,
        the answer gates) declines while ``_recovering`` rather than reporting
        an outcome the replacement owner has not agreed to (review MINOR-1).

        The HTTP twin of the TUI's ``_start_runtime_engage`` worker
        (``tui/app.py``): same ``foreground=False`` envelope, same silence on
        failure, same reason — a speculative warm-up the user did not ask for
        must never become an error they have to read, and the real send that
        follows engages again through this same lock and reports properly.

        WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The desktop/HTTP surface had no way to engage a
        runtime without also submitting work, so the first message POST for a
        session paid the whole cold engage inline — spawn, dial, welcome ack,
        frontend sync — measured at a 1146 ms median against 12-42 ms for the
        second send. Every other surface already warms off the critical path;
        this is that capability, reached over HTTP.

        ``foreground=False`` IS MANDATORY AND IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. Two
        distinct regressions follow from ``True``:

        * It claims the 15 s foreground bind budget for a bind nobody is
          waiting on, where the background envelope is what a speculative warm
          is entitled to; and
        * far worse, ``_bind_lock_for(foreground=True)`` publishes on
          ``_foreground_waiting``/``_foreground_arrived``, so the warm would
          announce itself as a user-visible caller and **preempt itself** out
          of that generous envelope.

        The related hazard — a warm holding ``_bind_lock`` on the background
        budget while a real send queues behind it — is already solved and must
        stay solved by the EXISTING mechanism: the send announces itself
        foreground before acquiring, the in-flight warm samples
        ``_foreground_arrived`` before its engage, and the cut is
        ``_BACKGROUND_YIELD_BUDGET_S``. The precedent for opting out is
        measured: a foreground caller waiting 134.5 s against 29.5 s once a
        bind took the lock raw. So this method must never grow its own
        ``wait_for``, its own timeout, or a raw ``async with self._bind_lock``
        — the entire safety argument is that it is the ordinary background
        engage and nothing else.

        The seam between "looking at a session" and "working in one", and the
        only place a viewer creates a process. Serialised by a lock because
        several mutating calls can arrive in the same tick (a prompt racing the
        speculative warm engage the first keystroke started) and each must
        wait for the SAME engagement rather than starting a second.

        Scoped to VIEWER facades (``_can_go_cold``). The legacy attach path
        keeps its own contract for a lost owner — recover the conversation into
        this process, or report the deliberate stop — and engaging a runtime
        there would both contradict that and start a process for a session the
        caller is about to take over itself.

        ``foreground`` picks the envelope, and it defaults to the SHORT one so
        a caller that forgets cannot accidentally hand a user a two-minute
        wait. Pass ``foreground=False`` only from a bind nobody is watching:
        the TUI's speculative mount/keystroke engage and the desktop proxy,
        both of which are silent on failure. The budgets compose — 30 s engage
        plus a 15 s welcome ack sit AHEAD of the sync wait on the same call —
        so a generous sync envelope reaching a foreground caller would make
        the very wait this fix exists to shorten longer instead.

        A bind that fails is retried a bounded number of times rather than
        surrendering on the first ``ConnectionError``: see the retry constants
        for why that is safe (``_bind_to`` discards its rejected client on
        every failure path, so no attach slot leaks) and why the record is
        re-read per attempt.

        Picking the envelope is not enough on its own, because every caller
        queues on the same ``_bind_lock``: a foreground caller arriving while a
        BACKGROUND bind holds it would wait out that bind's budget before
        starting its own. So a foreground caller announces itself on
        ``_foreground_waiting`` BEFORE acquiring, and the background holder
        shortens its own remaining envelope in response. See
        ``_BACKGROUND_YIELD_BUDGET_S`` for why the background bind yields time
        rather than the lock: handing over the lock would discard an
        authenticated dial and risk a second engage for one session's lease.

        """Wait for the canonical sync on LIVENESS, with the clock as a backstop.

        The future is a PARAMETER, not ``self._frontend_future``. Re-reading the
        attribute across the await left the identity unpinned: a concurrent
        ``_discard_rejected_client`` nulls it (producing the sibling "owner did
        not start frontend synchronization" refusal for a dial that was fine)
        and a concurrent redial replaces it, so the caller could end up awaiting
        a DIFFERENT dial's future. ``_ensure_bound`` holds ``_bind_lock`` but
        ``_recover_runtime`` never takes it, so the two are ordered only by the
        ``_recovering`` flag — not by a lock. Threading the future through the
        call closes that seam by construction, which is why the ``None`` case
        below is an internal invariant rather than an owner fault.

        The wait itself follows ``AGENTS.md``'s "wait on the event, never on the
        clock". The socket IS the progress signal and it is already wired: a
        connection that dies fails the future through ``_dial``'s
        ``on_disconnected`` with the pump's own named reason, in milliseconds.
        So a live socket with no sync yet means the owner is working or the box
        is starved — both worth waiting for — while every real failure resolves
        long before ``timeout``. That leaves the clock doing only what
        ``AGENTS.md`` calls it: a backstop, not the assertion.

        ``timeout`` is a parameter because the two envelopes are genuinely
        different budgets and one constant cannot serve both: a foreground bind
        has a user waiting on a specific command (and its budget composes with
        the engage and welcome deadlines, see ``FRONTEND_SYNC_FOREGROUND_S``),
        while a background engage or recovery has nobody waiting and should
        outlast a busy authoritative loop rather than surrender to it.

        ``preempt`` is how the second half of that guarantee is kept. "Nobody
        waiting" is true when a background wait STARTS and can stop being true
        while it runs — the ordinary TUI boot, where the mount engage is in
        flight when the user's first prompt arrives. Passed the event, this
        wait stops promising the generous envelope the moment someone begins
        waiting on it and finishes inside ``_BACKGROUND_YIELD_BUDGET_S``
        instead. It is an EVENT rather than a polled flag for the same reason
        the sync itself is: the wakeup lands on the turn the arrival happens.

        Preemption shortens the deadline only; it never abandons the dial. The
        socket stays open and the future stays the same object, so a sync that
        lands inside the shortened window is still adopted normally, and one
        that does not fails through the identical backstop arm below.

        Deliberately NOT ``_invalidate_display_history``, even though it shares
        that method's task and lock. That one returns early unless
        ``_display_window_supported``, because it exists for DISPLAY history
        drift — and a degraded delta drops canonical FIELDS (roster, usage,
        gates), which every follower has whether or not it negotiated a windowed
        history. Gating this on that flag would leave legacy and full-replay
        viewers permanently stale on exactly the frame this fix is about.

        It reuses ``_refresh_display_history`` rather than adding a second
        recovery path so there is one place that captures a cut, buffers live
        deltas and installs them in order. That method re-snapshots the whole
        canonical state through ``frontend_sync``, which is a superset of what a
        shed body could have carried.

        DEGRADED FRAMES ARRIVING DURING A REFRESH FOLD INTO ONE FURTHER PASS.
        Two existing mechanisms provide that and are reused rather than
        duplicated: the task slot is only refilled when the previous refresh has
        finished, and ``_refresh_display_history`` loops on
        ``_display_invalidated`` under its lock. Deltas arriving during the
        refresh are buffered and replayed, and the refresh cut discards those
        the snapshot already covers.

        That bound is IN-FLIGHT COALESCING, not a rate limit, and the difference
        is worth stating because the docstring here used to overclaim it. Frames
        spaced further apart than one refresh takes each get their own sync:
        measured over a real socket, 20 oversized frames cost 1 sync back to
        back and 20 syncs at 50 ms apart. That is the correct behaviour rather
        than a gap — each of those frames shed state a completed snapshot did
        not cover, so skipping its sync would leave the follower stale, which is
        the bug this method exists for. What must never happen is one sync per
        frame while a refresh is ALREADY running, which is what the slot
        prevents. Cost is bounded by the refresh round trip (~2 s for the 20
        paced frames above) on a session already shedding 1.5 MB deltas.

        THE RETRY BELONGS TO THE SLOT, NOT TO ONE CREATOR'S TASK (review round
        2, B2). The first version of this attached the retrying callback only to
        the task ``_resync_after_degraded_delta`` created, while
        ``_invalidate_display_history`` filled the SAME slot with a log-only
        one. A degraded frame arriving while that pass was in flight took the
        early return above and handed its debt to a task that re-armed nothing —
        the original defect, one route over, reachable in production from a
        ``history_generation`` move and from ``CompactionEndEvent``. Reproduced
        on that tree with a 1,528,060-byte delta: live socket, sequence 22/22 so
        the gap check agrees forever, follower title stuck at its pre-degrade
        value through 20 later healthy deltas, catalogue 0 rows against the
        owner's 5000, and ``ensure_display_current`` re-raising the stored error
        on every call. A cached task holding a FAILURE is not a cache, it is a
        latch.

        So every filler of ``_display_refresh_task`` goes through here, and the
        callback READS the debt flag rather than assuming who armed it: a pass
        started for display drift that happens to consume a degrade debt retries
        it, and a pass with no debt outstanding still only logs, exactly as the
        display-invalidation path always did.

        The failure path is the whole point. ``_frontend_resync_pending`` is
        cleared BEFORE the capture inside ``_refresh_display_history`` (so a
        frame racing the snapshot earns another pass), and that method restores
        what it consumed when it re-raises — so the flag read below is an honest
        statement of whether canonical fields are still owed. Without the retry,
        a single transient failure leaves the debt forgotten and the follower
        showing stale fields behind a gap check that agrees with the owner
        forever. Reproduced: one injected ``ConnectionError`` left a live socket
        at sequence 11/11 with the follower's title stuck at its pre-degrade
        value through ten subsequent healthy deltas.

        ``prior_delay`` is the backoff this attempt already waited out. It is
        bookkeeping for the NEXT delay only — the pass itself never sleeps, so
        ``_display_refresh_task`` never holds a sleeping task for
        ``ensure_display_current`` to block a navigating TUI on.

        finished between the read and the bind, or the one it is still in.
        :meth:`_replay_durable_suffix` never ran for that gap, because a
        facade that has never hydrated has no ``previous`` window to measure

        silently missing from the screen on every paint-first attach, which
        is the TUI's ``/resume`` and ``lop --resume`` onto a live owner.

        The fix is to un-claim exactly the ids the cold read did NOT paint and

        them again and emits them as ONE typed delta ahead of the buffered live

        :meth:`_replay_durable_suffix` skips it for the same reason — so
        releasing "" would release nothing. It is not lost: the TUI projects its

        news stopped. The TUI installs its settle/wiring sink on the session it
        adopts (``OperatorApp._wire_mcp_status``), and on the in-process
        ``Session`` that sink is how the boot toast and the durable failure

        on this class ever read, so on the viewer path a failed server reached
        ``mcp_startup`` and no screen at all: no toast, no notice, only ``/mcp``.
        That is the operator's "instead of throwing up the toast that some MCPs
        failed to load", and it is why the deferred-wiring change (which makes
        the report land AFTER the bind) had to be paired with this.

        Fired only on a CHANGE, and only for a non-empty outcome. The owner
        pushes the same snapshot repeatedly (every canonical refresh carries it),

        sentence record exists to suppress. An EMPTY outcome is the machine with

        # mounts and takes keystrokes is a question the app cannot honour —

        the whole session under it, and a viewer going cold has no runtime
        left to hear from. Marked through the normal event path so no
        card/banner or attach vocabulary appears.

        ``aborted``/``error`` are the CALLER's verdict, and the cut-off work
        makes that explicit rather than leaving the default to speak for every
        case: a deliberate stop or a kill keeps ``aborted=True, error=None``
        (the shape a user's Esc produces), while a confirmed owner death passes
        ``aborted=False, error=<cut-off notice>`` so the app paints a named
        failure instead of a cancel it cannot explain.

        ``direct`` bypasses the sync buffer and hands the end straight to the
        subscribed handlers (dropping it when there are none). The go-cold
        caller needs this: a failed successor ``_dial`` leaves
        ``_ready_for_events`` False, so a BUFFERED end would sit until the
        NEXT bind's ``_finish_sync`` drained it — behind that bind's seeded
        ``AgentStartEvent`` — and would tear down the new turn it never
        belonged to. Delivered now it ends the one it does.

        UNSTAMPED (``generation=0``), never ``self._generation`` — review
        round 1, BLOCKER-1. That field is not this viewer's own turn counter:
        ``_apply_frontend_facades`` overwrites it from whatever snapshot last
        arrived, and a SUCCESSOR is a fresh runtime whose counter restarts
        (``Session.__init__`` sets 0, so its first turn is 1) while the app's
        ``EventController`` has adopted the PREVIOUS owner's generation — 6,
        or any long session's turn count. Stamping the synthesised end with
        the successor's number therefore made ``_handle_agent_end`` drop it as
        ``gen < current`` (``tui/events.py``), so the end reached the handler
        and died one layer below it: no ``TurnEnded``, and — with edit 1's
        hold in place and no wall-clock timeout by design — a band and tab
        title asserting ``working`` for the rest of the process's life. ``0``
        is the field's default and the established "unstamped: belongs to
        whatever turn is open" encoding that the controller's ``if gen:``
        branch reads, which is exactly the semantics a locally synthesised end
        wants. It applies to the buffered path for the same reason: neither

        WHY. The durable outcome a sidebar row reads is written by
        ``bootstrap_transcript`` — the same classifier the next boot runs — and
        until something ran it, a session whose runtime died mid-turn read
        ``Working`` and then ``Recent`` in active sessions, never ``errored``:
        the operator's requirement is literally "so at least we see it in
        active sessions as errored", and it was unmet for every session nobody
        had opened yet (UX round 2, U6). A viewer that has just DELIVERED the
        cut-off verdict is the one place that knows both that it happened and
        which directory to classify, and it is ONE classification per death —
        not the per-row orphan scan on the refresh path whose cost is the
        reason this was deferred.

        The CLASSIFIER's verdict is published, never this facade's own
        ``owner-lost`` — except where the classifier CANNOT run, which is the
        one case ``cause`` is for (review round 1, MINOR-2). Opening the same
        session runs exactly this classifier and gets ``runtime-killed`` (or the
        no-evidence sentence); two sentences for one death, depending on which
        surface you looked at, is the divergence the taxonomy exists to prevent.
        But when a record on disk still points at a live pid, the classifier's
        in-flight arm publishes NOTHING by design — it cannot tell a dead owner
        behind a recycled pid from a healthy run — so the give-up arm that ends
        a live-but-silent chase used to leave the sidebar row un-errored while
        the terminal carried a named ``owner-lost`` verdict.

        PUBLISHED PROVISIONALLY, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THAT SAFE. The record this
        writes is ``provisional_anchor(token)``, so the live owner's real
        outcome — same token, real anchor — SUPERSEDES it
        (``AttentionStore._supersedes_provisional``), and a viewer that mistook
        a stall for a death cannot leave a wrong row behind. Meanwhile the
        surfaces a live session is showing are exactly where a provisional
        ``error`` is suppressed while it is still busy, which is why the wrong
        row cannot outrank work in progress.

        Fire-and-forget on the default executor, fully guarded, and deliberately
        so: this is a notice for OTHER surfaces, and nothing about painting this

        2. Someone ELSE stopped the session (another TUI's ``/stop all``, a

           ``stopped_at`` on the wake-index entry (a durable, transcript-
           derived marker — survives the owner's exit, readable before any
           reconnect), and the owner never rediscovers. Both conditions

           the marker absent, a stopped one leaves it set.

        DECLARED on :class:`ViewerSessionProtocol` rather than kept private,
        because a host that missed the disconnect still has to tell the two
        apart: the sidebar's connect re-dials a clicked row, and an owner that

        in the TUI.

        ITS LIMIT, stated because a caller may need to act on the absence: the

        ready — the next prompt engages a runtime through ``_ensure_bound``
        instead of waiting for one that is never coming back.

        ``refresh`` is the planned-retirement variant (``RETIRING_REASON``):
        the runtime was idle by contract when it left, so there is no turn to
        end — ``_end_turn_locally`` is skipped, which is what keeps a refresh

        A turn still in flight is ENDED through the event path, not merely

        synthesises an abort (a dropped socket is usually a stalled viewer,
        not a dead runtime), so go-cold is the verdict that the runtime is
        actually gone. The other case it exists for is a SUCCESSOR dying
        mid-reattach — ``_on_disconnected`` returns early while
        ``_recovering``, and ``_apply_frontend_facades`` has just re-marked
        the turn live from the successor's snapshot — which leaves
        ``_streaming`` True with nothing else on the way to clear it.
        Delivered ``direct`` for the reason on ``_end_turn_locally``: the

        # measured rather than rhetorical (review round 2, MINOR-2). The
        # deadline is tested at the top of a pass and ``paced()`` parks the
        # loop AT it, so a successor that publishes inside the final sleep is
        # never dialled from here: with the bound monkeypatched to 0.5 s and a
        # record appearing at t+0.49 s, the loop released at 0.506 s having
        # dialled that record ZERO times. What catches it is the released
        # caller's next action, which re-enters through ``_ensure_bound``
        # against the very same record. An earlier draft of this comment
        # claimed the loop itself reattached "the moment a record it can use
        # appears", which the boundary case falsifies. The early release
        # cannot double-bind or double-spawn because ``engage_runtime``
        # short-circuits on a discoverable record and otherwise waits rather

        The single exit for every arm that has not produced a usable runtime

        use, a record that never answers, and a takeover arm that cannot run in
        this viewer (``_takeover_factory`` raising on every pass — UX round 2,
        U7). One method rather than a copy per branch, because the ordering rule
        below is load-bearing and a second copy is how it gets forgotten.

        ``after`` is the bound that expired, and it is only logged: the bound
        differs per arm at most in which constant is named, and the log line is
        what lets a reader tell which arm released the facade without reading
        the source.

        LOAD-BEARING, and it must precede ``_go_cold``: ``_ensure_bound``
        returns immediately when ``_can_go_cold`` is False, so clearing
        ``_recovering`` while leaving that flag unset would produce a viewer that
        reports ``is_cold`` and can NEVER bind again — a silent no-op in place of
        today's honest refusal, which is the worse bug. Mirrors the refresh arm
        of ``_go_cold``, which flips the same flag with the same reasoning: from
        here on this facade is a viewer.

        deserialization — and then discarded by the parked controller. The

        delta-grade frames while parked — the same three types the parked

        reveal, where the presentation rebuilds from history plus the canonical
        live seed exactly as it already does after any parked gap.
