"""Durable, revision-bound completion receipts shared by local frontends.

A connection is not a read. Only an explicit acknowledgement of a published
completion token advances the watermark. Tokens are conversation-bound and do
not depend on a process epoch, a wall clock, or transcript modification time.
SQLite serializes the short transactions across TUI, relay and server processes;
callers on an event loop run these operations in a worker thread.

TWO WATERMARKS, DELIBERATELY SEPARATE. ``receipts.acknowledged`` says a human
demonstrably READ a result; ``deliveries.delivered`` says somebody already
NOTIFIED them about it. They ride the same monotonic ``completions.sequence``
but must never be conflated: notifying is cheap and reversible, marking-read is
destructive, and ``docs/SESSION_SIDEBAR.md`` pins the rule that routing a
notification never marks anything read. A session can be delivered-and-unread
forever, which is correct — the sidebar's checkmark stays until it is opened.

BULK ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IS TOKEN-BOUND, NEVER A SWEEP (:meth:`AttentionStore.
acknowledge_many`). A surface may acknowledge the completions it can ENUMERATE,
each by the token it actually rendered; a completion published after that render
is not in the batch and stays unread. The tempting shortcut — advance every
conversation's watermark to its own ``MAX(sequence)`` — clears a completion the
operator never saw, the exact hazard this mechanism exists to prevent, and it is
deliberately not offered (``docs/ATTENTION.md``, rule R10). No automatic path may
acknowledge anything either: a read receipt is a user gesture on a rendered
result, never a timer, a poll or a focus change.

ATTENTION_CUSTOM_TYPE = "completion_attention"

#: How long SQLite itself waits for a competing writer before answering
#: ``SQLITE_BUSY``, in milliseconds, and the driver's matching window.
#:
#: THE HOUSE RANGE, AND THIS STORE WAS THE OUTLIER. Every sibling store sets a
#: busy timeout with a written rationale -- ``secrets/store.py`` 10000 ("covers
#: the brief writer-lock contention concurrent sessions do still produce"),
#: ``providers/usage_cache.py`` 5000, ``providers/auth_store.py`` 5000 -- and
#: ``attention.db`` shipped a bare ``connect(timeout=2.0)`` with no PRAGMA at
#: all, from when one process at a time wrote it. It is now the MOST contended
#: store on the machine: ~25 concurrent ``lop`` sessions plus the mobile daemon,
#: the tunnel connector and the browser bridge all publish completions into the
#: one file, and every publish is a ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` that also runs the
#: additive schema check. Two seconds expires first, the completion is lost, and
#: the caller is handed ``OperationalError`` -- which for a daemon request
#: handler is an outage rather than a late notification (2026-09-20,
#: ``~/Library/Logs/local-operator/mobile.log``).
_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000

#: The driver's own busy handler, set alongside the PRAGMA for the reason
#: ``auth_store`` sets both: ``timeout`` covers the connection before the PRAGMA
#: has run, and the PRAGMA is what a reader of this file looks for.
_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S = 5.0

#: Bounded retry for the DELETE->WAL journal-mode transition, which ``busy_timeout``
#: does NOT cover: changing the journal mode needs an EXCLUSIVE lock, and SQLite
#: fails that acquisition with ``SQLITE_BUSY`` immediately instead of invoking the
#: busy handler, so the 5 s window set one statement earlier buys nothing at this
#: statement. This is the same shape and budget as ``analytics/store.py``'s
#: ``_WAL_RETRIES``/``_WAL_RETRY_BACKOFF_S``, deliberately reused rather than
#: reinvented: the transition is a one-way conversion of a file several processes
#: open at once, and two hand-written answers to it would be two chances to get it
#: wrong. Measured there on a fresh database opened by 16 processes at once: 25/320
#: opens raised ``database is locked`` at this statement, and setting
#: ``busy_timeout`` first only brought that to 15/320 -- reordering alone is not a
#: fix; this loop took the same probe to 0/320.
#:
#: Only the FIRST writer to reach a fresh file pays anything: once the file is in
#: WAL the pragma is a no-op that cannot fail, so a connection to an established
#: store runs one extra header-reading statement and no more.
_WAL_RETRIES = 6
_WAL_RETRY_BACKOFF_S = 0.05

#: How many times a contended ACQUISITION is re-attempted, and how long to wait
#: before the retry, in seconds -- ONE scalar, deliberately, not a tuple per
#: attempt. The store owns the connection and the transaction, so it is where
#: riding out a lock belongs: see :meth:`AttentionStore._retry_write` and
#: :meth:`AttentionStore._retry_read`, which share this budget.
#:
#: THE COUPLING IS SAFE NOW. This used to be ``_WRITE_BACKOFF_S = (0.2,)``
#: indexed by attempt, so the very variant the surrounding text discusses --
#: three attempts -- raised ``IndexError`` on the third attempt instead of
#: retrying (review round 1, MINOR-3). A scalar cannot be indexed out of range,
#: and it says what is true: the wait is the same between attempts.
#:
#: ONE retry, and the bound is MEASURED rather than derived. THE METHOD, so the
#: number can be reproduced and so a maintainer resizing this budget does not
#: have to trust it: a sibling connection holds ``BEGIN EXCLUSIVE`` on a fresh
#: copy of the store (proven to block both a reader and a writer before it is
#: trusted), the blocked statement keeps SQLite's default busy handler, and the
#: wait until it raises is timed -- three samples per window, this host, python
#: 3.12.13 / sqlite 3.50.4. At the shipped 5 s window ONE acquisition point costs
#: 5.31-5.37 s, i.e. **1.061-1.074x**, and the same holds at 2 s (1.069-1.082x)
#: and 1 s (1.091-1.114x); a fixed handler/connect cost (~15-40 ms) is what makes
#: small windows look worse (200 ms -> 1.21-1.25x, 50 ms -> 1.26-1.36x). It is the
#: ratio at ONE acquisition point that the previous version of this comment got
#: wrong -- it claimed ~1.8x ("50 ms -> 0.27 s, 2 s -> 3.8 s, 5 s -> 9.3 s"):
#: those figures are not what a window costs, and reading them as a per-window
#: cost is what produced the ~19 s budget this comment used to justify two
#: attempts with (review round 1, MINOR-2; QA round 1, Q-1).
#:
#: WHERE THE HIGHER COST DOES COME FROM: an attempt can pay the window at TWO
#: acquisition points, and the write's own COMMIT is the second one --
#: ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` waits for a RESERVED holder, then the implicit COMMIT under
#: ``with conn:`` waits for a SHARED reader. That is the innermost frame of the
#: operator's incident traceback (`_connect`'s ``with conn:``), i.e. the 12
#: publish failures died AFTER acquiring RESERVED, and it is why the budget must
#: be sized from a measurement of the two-window shape rather than from a single
#: window's ratio.
#:
#: SO THE BUDGETS, at the shipped 5 s window and two attempts, measured on the
#: real store (``AttentionStore.publish`` / ``revision`` against a held lock):
#:
#: * a READ pays at one point (it takes SHARED and never writes): 10.80-10.84 s;
#: * a WRITE pays at one point when only the COMMIT is blocked (10.80 s) and at
#:   two when RESERVED is held as well (**12.09 s**, with a 1.2 s RESERVED hold).
#:
#: Two attempts is therefore the largest budget whose worst case still answers a
#: turn's ``finally`` promptly -- ~12 s, against ~16-17 s for a third attempt --
#: and the second window is what absorbs a burst that outlasts the first. A lock
#: that outlasts both is what the journal beside the store is for: the outcome is
#: durable in the transcript before it is published, and the owning session
#: republishes it in-process on a bounded ladder (see
#: ``Session._schedule_attention_republish``), with the next boot's import as the
#: fallback rather than the only remedy.
_CONTENTION_ATTEMPTS = 2

#: verdicts, which is why this is an import rather than a two-name literal.

    deliberately (marker naming sigkill), reopened, run again, and then die
    involuntarily; without this check the SURVIVING marker would narrate the

    a durable marker can introduce. So: the session id must be this
    conversation's, and the marker has to be shown to describe THIS run by
    whichever run key is available.

    The taxonomy's default flips here: "no evidence" used to mean
    ``interrupted`` and now means ``error``, because a cut-off we cannot explain
    is not a stop. Only POSITIVE evidence of a deliberate act records an
    interruption. Evidence, in order:

    * a DURABLE STOP MARKER staged by the process that took the irreversible
      step (``runtime-stop.json``) → ``interrupted`` / ``user-stop``, with the
      rung and the killer as the detail. It outranks everything below because
      it is the only evidence a forced stop can leave: the target at the
      SIGKILL rung is not executing;
    * a stop recorded in the wake index (the in-process stop path) →
      ``interrupted`` / ``user-stop``, no detail;
    * THE RUNTIME'S OWN OPEN TURN JOURNAL ROW (``runtime/journal.py``) → a
      NAMED involuntary cause: ``runtime-shutdown`` when the row itself recorded
      the signal the runtime was leaving on (a stop sweep that reached its
      target), ``install-mid-update`` when the install on disk moved away from
      the build the row booted from (the install-window tear), and
      ``runtime-killed`` otherwise. This rung is what turns the third case below
      from an inference into a fact: an open row IS the runtime's own statement
      that a turn was in flight and never ended, which is the evidence the two
      rungs below cannot have. It sits BELOW the marker rungs deliberately — a
      marker is a killer's attestation that someone asked for this, and nothing
      about an unfinished turn may outrank a record that the stop was ordered;
    * a record on disk whose pid is dead → ``error`` / ``runtime-killed``, with
      the record's build, pid and start time as the detail, prefixed by
      ``incidents.KILL_UNATTRIBUTED`` because the only party this rung can name is
      the victim — the legacy path, reached unchanged when no journal row survives;
    * nothing at all → ``error`` / no cause, saying plainly that the cause could
      not be determined.

    Why the marker is FIRST, and why the order is the fix. Before it existed,
    the same event (a stop that escalated to SIGKILL against a runtime that
    could not answer) reached the operator as three incompatible verdicts —
    ``runtime-killed`` here, no cause at all once a sweep had reaped the record,
    and ``owner-lost`` viewer-side — because every rung below reports what the
    process left behind and a SIGKILLed process leaves NOTHING. A marker is
    written by the killer before the signal, so the deliberate act survives the
    process it was done to, and one event yields exactly one verdict.

    ``reaped_owner`` IS THE DEAD RUNG'S EVIDENCE WHEN SOMEBODY ALREADY TOOK IT.
    ``registry.scan`` moves a stale record into a sidecar as it reports it (it
    used to DELETE it), and this reader reads that sidecar too — so the daemon's
    discovery loop can sweep before the classifier runs and the classification
    is unchanged. The caller's own record is still preferred when it has one,
    because it is strictly more evidence (the sweep may have run before the
    caller proved the pid dead). Only the DEAD rung uses it: the marker rungs
    answer for themselves, and the caller's live-owner gate
    (:func:`_run_record_evidence` inside :func:`_import_transcript_outcome`) has
    already run, so a successor that published while the record was being reaped
    still wins.

    ``run_started_at`` IS THE MARKER RUNG'S SECOND RUN KEY. The marker is keyed
    to a run, and when no record survives to compare pid and start time against,
    the run's own start — the in-flight ``attention_started`` entry's timestamp,
    passed by the caller that already read it — is what keeps a marker from an
    EARLIER stop of the same session from narrating a later involuntary death as
    the user's own act (QA round 1, Q-1; see :func:`_stop_marker_covers_run` for
    why the bound is the marker's own stamp and not the target's ``started_at``).
    ``None`` — no entry, or a caller that has no transcript — keeps the
    marker-only answer, because refusing on no evidence would delete the
    attribution the rung-3 shape exists for.

    THE NO-EVIDENCE ARM CARRIES NO CAUSE AND ITS OWN SENTENCE. It used to read
    the ``runtime-killed`` sentence with a ``(the cause could not be determined)``
    parenthetical bolted on, and every surface that prints the reason made that
    a contradiction: the sidebar's ``_error_label`` drops a parenthetical by
    design (it is built for the build pair), so the one surface that trims the
    detail stated a definite cause in the one case where nothing is known
    (design/UX review round 1, D3/U3). ``CUT_OFF_UNKNOWN`` already exists for
    this branch and needs no hedging, and leaving ``cause`` empty is what keeps
    ``cause_from_reason(reason)`` — the inverse every reader relies on —
    agreeing with the reason instead of naming a mechanism nobody observed.

    Returns the ``(kind, cause, reason, token)`` this call PUBLISHED — for an
    orphaned in-flight run, or for the dying runtime's own saved marker when that
    marker reports a CUT-OFF — and ``None`` when it published nothing new. The
    caller that owns a ``Session`` (and can therefore journal) uses it to
    narrate the cut-off once per token; the daemon sweep, which has no session,
    ignores it.

    An in-flight ``attention_started`` with no matching outcome means a process
    died mid-turn — or is STILL RUNNING it. The two are told apart by the run
    registry, and only the second may publish nothing: a provisional marker
    written for a healthy run would be a wrong ``error`` row that every
    surface's ``busy`` suppression HIDES rather than corrects, so the guard
    removes the class instead of relying on every front end's suppression.
    ``witnessed_cut_off`` is the ONE caller that may override that guard, and
    only a caller holding POSITIVE evidence the owner is gone: a ``(cause,
    reason)`` pair from a viewer that has just DELIVERED a cut-off verdict after
    the whole cold window of failed dials and syncs. It publishes a PROVISIONAL
    record for the run's token, so the live owner's real outcome supersedes it
    when it lands (``_supersedes_provisional``) — which is what lets a
    live-but-silent stop reach the sidebar without inventing a second, permanent
    verdict (review round 1, MINOR-2).

    Old baselines were memory-only. Unknown historical work keeps that no-flood
    baseline, while a persisted seen stamp older than the actual final assistant
    entry preserves unread. Metadata file mtimes are deliberately irrelevant.

        WHY THE MODE MOVES HERE AT ALL. This is the last multi-writer store in
        the config root still in SQLite's default rollback journal: ``analytics.db``
        and ``auth.db`` are both WAL, and this one is the file the docstring above
        names as reaching "~25 concurrent sessions, the mobile daemon, the tunnel
        connector and the browser bridge". In rollback mode a writer takes an
        EXCLUSIVE lock that blocks every reader for the length of its transaction,
        so a publisher's ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` -- which also runs the additive schema
        check -- stalls `revision` and `published_since` on every other process.
        WAL removes that window: readers keep reading the last committed snapshot
        while a writer appends. A forced-WAL A/B on a copy of the live-shaped file
        measured 1,070 -> 926 ms CPU and 3.90 -> 3.01 s wall per 1,000 writes at
        n=50, with ZERO ``database is locked`` errors in EITHER mode -- the 5 s
        ``busy_timeout`` above already absorbs contention, so what WAL buys here is
        wall time and the EXCLUSIVE-lock window over readers, not fewer errors.
        Do not re-derive that as an error-rate fix.

        WHY A RETRY AND NOT A PLAIN PRAGMA. ``busy_timeout`` does not cover this
        statement: the conversion needs an exclusive lock and SQLite answers
        ``SQLITE_BUSY`` immediately rather than invoking the busy handler. See
        ``_WAL_RETRIES`` for the measurement. A database that stays un-WAL after
        every attempt is STILL USABLE -- rollback mode serialises writers rather
        than losing them -- so this returns quietly instead of raising and costing
        the caller the whole operation, which is the same never-break-a-turn rule
        the rest of this store follows.

        READS CONTEND FOR THE SAME LOCK -- LESS OFTEN NOW, BUT STILL. This store
        moved to WAL (see :meth:`_set_wal`), so a reader no longer blocks behind a
        writer's EXCLUSIVE lock for the length of its transaction: it reads the
        last committed snapshot and the two proceed together, which is the
        ``revision``/``published_since`` window this lane set out to remove. What
        WAL does NOT remove is a reader meeting the transitions that still need
        exclusion -- a checkpoint, the one-time DELETE->WAL conversion, the
        recovery of a ``-wal`` left by a killed writer -- nor, on an ESTABLISHED
        database that has not converted yet, any of the old contention at all.
        The operator's log shows the daemon's own scan losing that race 36 times
        (`AttentionStore().revision` raising `database is locked` out of
        `_uninitialized`), which is why this method keeps the same 5 s window
        rather than 2 and the same bounded retry (:meth:`_retry_read`): widening
        the window alone only buys a longer wait before the same failure, and the
        historical failure it was measured against is still reachable.

        A ``mode=ro`` READER NEEDS THE ``-wal``/``-shm`` SIDECARS READABLE, which
        is the one thing WAL adds to this path's contract. Since SQLite 3.22 a
        read-only connection can read a WAL database whose sidecars exist and are
        readable, and it creates them when they do not and the DIRECTORY is
        writable -- both true here, because every process opening this file runs
        as the same uid against a config root it already writes (the assumption
        :meth:`_set_wal` spells out). A reader that could do neither would need
        ``immutable=1`` and would silently not see un-checkpointed commits, so
        this is asserted rather than assumed:
        ``test_a_read_only_reader_sees_a_converted_store``,
        ``test_a_read_only_reader_sees_a_fresh_delete_mode_store`` and
        ``test_a_read_only_reader_sees_a_store_with_a_wal_present`` cover the
        converted-in-this-test, never-converted and mid-WAL shapes.

        Deliberately NOT ``_connect``: the read paths must stay unable to create
        the file or migrate the schema (``mode=ro`` is the mechanism, and
        ``test_reads_do_not_create_or_mutate_storage`` pins it). Only the wait
        is shared.

        transient one must not become the caller's failure. The store owns the
        connection and the transaction, so this is where the second attempt --
        and the eventual classification -- belongs; a caller cannot retry a
        transaction it cannot see.

        WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. Publish sits on paths with no failure ladder to
        catch it: the turn's own ``finally`` (``Session._publish_attention_outcome``,
        which is what a runtime's ASGI request handler runs) and the mobile
        daemon's boot sweep. A raise there is not a late notification, it is a
        request that never completes -- the operator's 2026-09-20 outage, where
        one expiring lock answered the phone with an ASGI abort.

        floor. The measured worst case -- and the acquisition points it is paid
        at, which is what the deleted "about 19 s" figure got wrong -- is at the
        constants: 12.1 s for this path's two attempts, on the caller's thread
        (see :meth:`_retry_contention` for which callers give it a worker).

        code). A full disk, an unopenable store and a corrupt schema are not

        WHY THE READ CLASS NEEDED THIS TOO. Reads contend for the same lock as
        writes in this store's default rollback journal, and they are the
        MAJORITY of the incident: 36 RECORDS of the daemon's own scan dying
        inside `revision -> _uninitialized`, against 12 records on the publish
        path, over the 60 `database is locked` text OCCURRENCES in the
        operator's log -- two units, not one. Each scan record carries the
        phrase once and each publish record twice (its own header plus the last
        line of its traceback), so the same log reads (36/12/1 records,
        36/24/0 occurrences): the ASGI record carries the phrase zero times,
        which is why the records sum to 49 and the occurrences to 60. Round-3
        review MINOR-1 and round-3 QA Q-3 are the reason those two splits are
        spelled out instead of asserted: the 38/21/1 this paragraph used to
        print contradicted its own `12 x 2` and had no record behind the "1".
        Closing the exposed window to 5 s (what this PR did first) left those 36
        exactly as they were -- they were merely given a larger window before
        failing, with the phone's read routes still answering 500 on a lock the
        window could not outlast (review round 1, Q-2). A read that raises costs
        the caller its whole tick or its whole response, so it is ridden out like
        a write, not just widened.

        WHY A RETRY IS SAFE HERE, where `publish` needs an idempotency argument.
        The operation runs on a ``mode=ro`` connection: it holds SHARED, writes
        nothing, and re-running it cannot double-apply a change. There is no
        transaction to resume and no half-finished state to leave behind.

        WHAT ESCAPES IS CLASSIFIED, NOT BARE. An exhausted budget raises
        :class:`AttentionReadDeferred`, which carries ``SQLITE_BUSY`` through the
        same base the write verdict uses -- so the desktop ladder, and the TUI's
        `/notifications` probe, answer 503 "busy, retry" for a read exactly as
        they do for a write, and never 500 "the store is broken".

        The budget is shared with the write path (:meth:`_retry_contention`),
        and a read pays it at ONE acquisition point per attempt: measured 10.8 s
        worst case for the shipped two attempts, against the write's 12.1 s.

        A TOKEN MAY LEGITIMATELY ADVANCE OUT OF ITS PROVISIONAL RECORD, and
        refusing that used to brick a session permanently. One turn writes
        ``attention_started`` with token T and, on completion, writes the SAME T
        with the real anchor and kind. Anything that bootstraps while that turn
        is in flight — a mobile daemon sweep, a resume attempt, a killed runtime —
        publishes the provisional ``(completion-T, interrupted)`` marker first.
        When the turn then finishes and the conversation is next opened, the
        journal's authoritative ``(<entry id>, complete)`` arrives for the same
        T: not a conflict, just the same turn described exactly. Rejecting it
        raised out of ``bootstrap_transcript`` on every single spawn, so the
        runtime could never start and the conversation was unopenable forever.

        Supersession is deliberately narrow: same conversation, and the stored
        record must still wear the provisional shape — anchor
        ``completion-<token>``. (The stored KIND is no longer part of that shape:
        see ``_supersedes_provisional`` for why requiring ``interrupted`` would
        now be the bug.) Two refusals it does NOT relax. A token appearing under
        a DIFFERENT conversation stays an error, which is the integrity property
        this check exists for: a forked transcript carrying its parent's journal
        must not capture the parent's receipt. And a record already anchored to
        a real entry is never replaced, so a late bootstrap racing a finished
        turn cannot drag a real outcome back to a synthetic one.

        A genuinely interrupted turn is stored in that same provisional shape,
        and that is intended rather than an ambiguity to resolve: the only
        writer that can present a different outcome for an existing token is
        this conversation's own journal replaying that same run, so the record
        it supersedes is by construction a description of the run that the
        journal now describes better. An unrelated turn always carries its own
        freshly minted token.

        The supersede is an UPDATE IN PLACE, which is what keeps it idempotent
        and flood-free: ``sequence`` is the receipt watermark, so minting a new
        row would resurrect an ALREADY-ACKNOWLEDGED turn as unread and re-fire
        a notification for a result the human has read. Correcting a record is
        not a new completion. Holding the sequence also means a corrected old
        turn stays where it belongs in the order instead of jumping ahead of
        newer ones.

        THAT CHOICE HAS A COST, and it is paid explicitly rather than left
        implicit (review round 1, major-1). Holding ``sequence`` means the heal
        moves neither term of the OLD ``revision()``, and two consumers gate on
        that value: the desktop bridge skips ``refresh_attention`` and keeps
        serving the stale ``interrupted`` record with its synthetic anchor to
        phone and desktop subscribers, and the TUI's background notifier skips
        its catalog scan. On a quiet machine a phone could show "Interrupted"
        for a turn that completed successfully, until some unrelated session
        happened to publish. So a supersede bumps ``mutations.supersedes``,
        which ``revision()`` folds into its tuple: the heal moves the change
        detector WITHOUT moving the watermark, and an acknowledged turn stays
        read. Detectable and flood-free are not in tension once they are
        separate counters.

        CONTENTION IS RIDDEN OUT HERE, NOT HANDED TO THE CALLER. The transaction

        THE TOKEN MUST BE THE CONVERSATION'S CURRENT COMPLETION, or the
        conversation must already be read. Anything else raises
        :class:`SupersededCompletionToken`, so a 200 from this method means one
        thing and only one: *this conversation is read now* (`unseen` false).

        WHY THE OLDER TOKEN IS REFUSED RATHER THAN RECORDED. The watermark is
        monotonic, so acknowledging an older token could only ever move the
        receipt to that token's sequence -- which, while a newer completion is
        still unseen, is a movement no surface can observe: `unseen` is computed
        against the NEWEST sequence, so the conversation stays unread either way.
        Returning 200 for it is what made the no-op indistinguishable from a read
        (the operator's defect: the desktop app sent a superseded token, got a
        200, latched, and its checkmark never cleared). The honest answer is that
        the caller is looking at a result the conversation has moved past: refuse
        it, and let the caller re-read the token that is current. THE REFUSAL
        CARRIES NO STATE, deliberately: the wire body is a machine ``code`` plus
        one operator-facing sentence (see :data:`SUPERSEDED_TOKEN_CODE`), because
        the state that settles this is the CALLER's own projection -- the thing it
        is already subscribed to and must refresh to learn which token is current
        now. A state computed here would be a second, already-stale opinion about
        a conversation the caller is watching, and a caller that trusted it
        instead of refreshing would be exactly as stuck as before. A DELAYED OR
        DUPLICATE RECEIPT STILL CONVERGES -- that is the
        case where the conversation is already read, and there this method answers
        with the read state exactly as before, which is what out-of-order
        delivery of a buffered receipt needs.

        The whole decision is made inside the write transaction: ``BEGIN
        IMMEDIATE`` serialises it against a concurrent :meth:`publish`, so the
        current sequence this compares against cannot be advanced under it, and
        the state returned was computed from the same snapshot.

        watermark sweep. See the module docstring for the rule and

          the conversation is already read. The receipt moves to
          ``MAX(existing, sequence)`` and ``state`` is computed in the same
          snapshot. Already-read items report ``read`` and move nothing, so a
          repeated batch is idempotent and does not bump :meth:`revision`.
        * ``superseded`` -- a real completion of that conversation that is no
          longer current while the conversation is still unseen. Nothing is
          written and no state is returned, for the reason :meth:`acknowledge`
          documents at length: the settling state is the caller's, and a copy
          computed here would be stale before it rendered.
        * ``unknown`` -- no ``completions`` row for that pair, including a store
          file that does not exist. Nothing is written, and this call never
          MATERIALISES the database (the read-only tolerance :meth:`state_many`
          and :meth:`claim_delivery` share): a refused receipt must not create
          the store it could not find.

        ONE TRANSACTION, and each half of that is load-bearing. A per-item
        transaction would expose a half-applied batch to every poller and take N
        write-lock acquisitions; one ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` gives atomic visibility
        (an observer sees all of the batch or none of it), one snapshot for every
        verdict (so a concurrent :meth:`publish` cannot advance a sequence
        underneath a comparison), and a whole-batch rollback on failure -- a
        ``sqlite3.Error`` here leaves no receipt moved, which is what lets the
        route answer through the shared store-failure ladder while claiming
        nothing. Item verdicts are
        NOT errors, so ``superseded``/``unknown`` items never roll the batch back.

        Touches ``receipts`` ONLY. ``deliveries`` is a different fact (somebody
        was told, and notifying is not reading), ``supersede_log``/``mutations``
        record heals rather than reads, and no ``completions`` row is inserted or
        renumbered -- so nothing can be resurrected as unread by clearing a pile.

        DUPLICATES ARE LEGAL AND EVALUATED IN ORDER: ``[{a, T1}, {a, T2}]``
        yields exactly one ``read`` and one verdict for the other,
        deterministically. Deliberately no dedupe -- one policy site, and a
        caller that sends a pair twice gets the same answer the single-item walk
        would give it.

        The arbitration point for N observer processes watching one shared
        store. Every frontend polls attention for every session, so without a
        claim, eleven running sessions would each announce the same completion
        eleven times. `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` is the serialization: both racers take
        the write lock, and the loser reads the winner's already-advanced
        watermark from inside its own transaction. This is the identical
        argument `receipts` already rests on, which is why the table lives here
        rather than beside the store in a lock file of its own.

        NEVER ACKNOWLEDGES. Delivering a toast about a session says nothing
        about whether the human read it, so this touches `deliveries` only and
        the sidebar's unseen mark survives untouched.

        CLAIM-THEN-DELIVER, deliberately. A process dying between the claim and
        the spawn loses that one toast; delivering first and claiming after
        would instead give a crash-looping process a repeating banner. The lost
        signal is only the transient nudge \u2014 `unseen` stays true, the checkmark
        stays in the sidebar, and `lop sessions` still reports it \u2014 whereas a
        duplicate is visible and repeats. Backends that can report their own
        failure hand the claim back through :meth:`release_delivery`.

        THE ACCEPTED RISK, stated plainly so the next reader does not have to
        rediscover it: a claimant killed between the claim and the spawn leaves
        that completion delivered-but-unannounced FOREVER. There is no lease,
        no holder pid and no expiry \u2014 a re-claim returns False for good, and
        nothing sweeps it. That is bounded in CONSEQUENCE (one transient toast,
        for one completion, on a process that crashed) and unbounded in TIME,
        and it is accepted here because the alternative trade is worse: a lease
        needs a clock, and a clock in this predicate is what lets two observers
        with disagreeing time both deliver. The durable signal survives
        regardless, which is what makes the transient one safe to lose. A lease
        carrying a holder pid is the natural fix if this ever stops being
        acceptable; the schema has no room for one today (review round 1 m1,
        QA round 1 Q3 \u2014 both judged the trade correct).

        A store that does not exist yet holds no completion to claim, so this
        never creates one: an arbitration read must not be the thing that
        materialises the database.
