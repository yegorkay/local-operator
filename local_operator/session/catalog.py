        """``(tier, wake_rank, -birth, id)`` — a wake orders the PREVIOUS group only.

        ``wake_rank`` is scoped to cold rows (``not self.active``): inside
        Previous an armed wake leads, then a dormant one, then everything else.
        Every ACTIVE row gets the same constant, so the key cannot reorder
        anything the user is currently working with.

        **Why scoped rather than uniform.** The first cut applied the key in
        every tier, on the reasoning that it "only breaks ties within one
        category" and so was free. That premise is empirically false, and three
        reviewers independently reproduced the consequences: rows inside a tier
        are NOT interchangeable, because a tier mixes states that
        :func:`~local_operator.tui.widgets.session_picker.row_state_mark`
        deliberately ranks against each other.

        * tier 5 mixes ``attached`` with ``idle``, so an idle session owning a
          timer sorted above the user's own ATTACHED current session — order
          contradicting the glyph ladder, where ``○`` means *a terminal is
          watching this session* and answers "where am I?".
        * tier 4 mixes ``busy`` with ``wedged``, so a WEDGED (broken) session
          needing a person sank below a merely-busy neighbour with a wake.
        * tier 0 mixes the approval and answer gates, so an armed pending row
          displaced an OLDER pending one — and note this third case defeats a
          guard written as "presence outranks a wake", because a pending row can
          carry an empty ``live_state``.

        Scoping to Previous removes all three at the root instead of enumerating
        the states to dodge. That distinction is the real lesson: an enumerated
        guard has to be updated every time the ``live_state`` vocabulary grows,
        and the tier-0 case above is exactly what such a guard silently misses.

        It is also what the operator actually asked for, which was scoped from
        the start — "under Previous Sessions ... sorted to the top". Tiers 0/4/5
        were never in scope, and reordering them is unrequested behaviour change.

        **Glyph/order parity, stated precisely.** In Active, order defers
        entirely to the existing precedence in ``row_state_mark``; this key
        abstains. In Previous every row is cold, so ``row_state_mark`` paints
        only the wake glyph or nothing at all — the wake is the sole
        forward-looking fact a row can carry, so it leads.

        **Dormant ranks below armed, not nowhere.** ``wakes_dormant`` means the
        session was deliberately stopped and the schedule will never fire, so it
        stays under every armed row: floating it would advertise a future that is
        not coming. It still gets its own band so that every clock glyph in the
        group is CONTIGUOUS. The dim-vs-muted separation between an armed ``◷``
        and a dormant one measures 1.77:1 at the 8x17px cell this UI renders —
        below any discrimination threshold — so a dormant row stranded among the
        plain rows reads as a broken sort rather than as a distinct state.
        Banding it directly under the armed rows puts the block boundary where
        the glyph changes, and costs no row and no chrome.

        The key lives HERE rather than in :func:`session_category` because that
        function is shared with the mobile daemon, whose summaries carry no wake
        data at all (durable rows come from ``recent_session_rows``, not
        ``decorate_rows``, so ``wakes`` is always 0 there). Moving the key into
        the shared categoriser would either be a no-op on mobile or force wake
        plumbing into the daemon; keeping it in the catalog leaves both surfaces
        agreeing on the tier, which is the partition they actually share.

        Stability: a wake is as durable a fact as ``live_state`` and ``pending``,
        and shares their best-effort read — ``decorate_rows`` zeroes ``wakes``
        for a poll whose wake-index read raises, exactly as it empties the live
        map when the registry scan raises, so a transient failure can bounce a
        row for one poll and put it back on the next. That tolerance is
        deliberate (a picker that cannot read either source still lists every
        session), and this key inherits it rather than adding a new fragility.
        What IS new is an asymmetry worth naming: a cold Previous row previously
        had no poll-varying ordering input at all, and now has one. When a wake
        genuinely fires the session becomes live and changes tier, which is a
        real state change rather than churn.

        One consequence reaches MEMBERSHIP, not just order: :func:`load_catalog`
        ranks before applying ``[:limit]``, so at the ``CATALOG_SCAN_LIMIT``
        boundary an ancient session carrying a wake — armed or dormant, since
        both bands outrank a plain row — can now enter the window and displace
        a newer row that would otherwise have made it (measured at 251
        sessions). That is arguably the point of the feature — a scheduled
        session is usually an old one, and being unfindable is the report — but
        it is a real behaviour change beyond reordering, so it is recorded here.

        THE single arbiter for that question: the sidebar reads it to decide
        whether to override :func:`row_state_mark`, and :attr:`status` reads it
        to decide whether to say "Unseen …". They used to make the decision
        separately, in matching order, held together by a comment asking the
        next author to keep them in step. That is what broke — and the pairing
        invariant this file already treats as load-bearing deserves a predicate
        rather than a promise.

        ``unseen`` is a LEVEL, not an edge: it is true from the moment a turn
        completes until somebody READS that session, and resuming a session
        does not acknowledge it. So the mark alone cannot be allowed to win —
        it says what the session did LAST, and the states below say what it is
        doing NOW:

        * ``pending`` — a parked gate. Already outranked unseen, and still
          does: a person is blocked on this row right now.
        * ``wedged`` — not answering NOW. A stale mark from a turn that did
          finish must not hide a runtime that has since stopped reporting, and
          a stale beat must not be read as death either: the words below say
          what was measured (``heartbeat_age_s``) rather than what it might
          mean.
        * ``busy`` — the reported bug. The session is working; painting the
          previous turn's outcome over its own spinner made seven resumed,
          healthy sessions read as seven failures.

        THE COST OF THE ``busy`` RULE, stated plainly because it is a real
        trade and not a free win: it suppresses an unread ``error`` exactly as
        it suppresses an unread ``interrupted``. A turn that FAILED, was
        resumed without being read, and is now running shows a spinner and a
        :attr:`status` of "Working" — the failure has no residue anywhere on
        the row, and the only route back to it is opening the session.

        That is accepted here, deliberately, on three grounds:

        1. Nothing is destroyed. This is a pure function of CURRENT state, not
           a latch: the instant the row stops being ``busy`` the ``✗`` and
           "Unseen error" come back, because ``unseen`` stays true until
           somebody actually reads the session.
        2. The row stays in "Active Sessions": membership is independent of
           ranking. While busy or wedged it uses the in-progress category, below
           unviewed completed outcomes; when it stops, its unread outcome earns
           that outcome's category again. Creation time orders each category.
        3. The alternative IS the reported bug, one class down. Painting an
           error mark over a running session's spinner is the same lie about
           the same row — "this is broken" over a session that is working.

        So the failure mode being accepted (a genuine error is quiet while its
        session runs, and returns when it stops) is strictly milder and strictly
        shorter-lived than the one being fixed (every resumed session claims to
        have failed, indefinitely, until read). If that trade ever needs
        revisiting, the cheap remedy is INK rather than shape — keep the
        spinner, tint it ``danger`` when ``completion_kind == "error"``, or
        widen the tooltip to "Working (last turn failed, unread)". Both are new
        design surface and belong in a round of their own, not here.

        Everything BELOW stays outranked by the mark, deliberately. ``attached``,
        an armed wake and ``idle`` are all facts about residency — true of a
        session that is merely sitting there — while "this finished and you
        have not read it" is a fact about work that is waiting for the
        operator. An unseen completion on a now-idle session is exactly the
        information the sidebar exists to keep, so it is kept.

        Ranking also suppresses stale completions while busy or wedged, so
        a row's category agrees with the live state its glyph communicates.

    * ``{N} subagent(s) running · {M} queued`` — the ``·`` addend shape

    (``46s`` -> ``47s`` -> ``1m``), so a wedged session's pair changes with the
    clock alone, with no write and no event behind it — roughly one change per
    second for the 45-59 s window after the beat crosses
    ``HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_S``, then one a minute, for every wedged session. A
    channel whose whole promise is "a frame per EVENT" cannot treat that as an
    edge, so it dedupes on this key and still PUBLISHES the pair.

    The key is the same derivation on the same row with the age cleared, which
    is a no-op for every arm but ``wedged`` (that arm is the only reader of
    ``heartbeat_age_s``). So it rides :func:`status_of` rather than restating the
    precedence, and the dedupe cannot drift from what the row says.

    The cost of the rule, stated because it is real: a client that keeps a
    wedged row's frame therefore keeps the label it was published with, and the
    age in that sentence stops advancing until the row's next real edge (or the
    client's own 30 s safety poll) refreshes it. A tooltip's age is not worth a

    to move a row the list does not move. The desktop feed asks this beside
    ``status_of`` because a row can need to change position while its pair changes

    ``include_archived`` is the archive predicate for the rows this function
    ADDS: a live record the scan did not carry is skipped when the archive store
    holds its id, unless the caller asked for archived rows — and when it is
    added it carries the store's own ``archived`` answer. It is not a filter over
    ``rows``, which the caller has already filtered; this is the site the
    REGISTRY path reaches, and the caller's own filters (the scan's predicate,
    the desktop-marker loop, the hidden layer) are the others — the registry
    knows nothing about archives, which is why one predicate in the scan was not
    enough (QA round 1, Q1; see the ``if include_live`` block).

    Two reads for the whole list: the discovery records say which sessions
    are running, working, attached or not answering, and the wake index says
    which have reminders armed. Best-effort — a picker that cannot read either
    one still lists every session exactly as it did before, because the
    fields are defaulted and the markers simply do not appear.

    BEST-EFFORT IS NOT SILENT, and this is the correction. The fields above are
    DEFAULTS, and a defaulted ``live_state=""`` is indistinguishable from a
    measured "this session is cold" — so when ``registry.scan`` was swallowed,
    ``CatalogEntry.active`` came out ``False`` for every row and the wire said
    ``active: false`` about a store with a running turn in it. The sidebar
    renders exactly that as the expanded "Active chats" section reading
    "Nothing running right now" while the collapsed section holds the rest: a
    swallowed read failure presented to the operator as "all my active chats
    disappeared".

    So a failed read now says so: the affected source is named on every row's
    :attr:`SessionRow.degraded`, the incident is logged at WARNING (``debug`` is
    invisible at the default level, which is why an incident could not be
    reconstructed from the logs afterwards), and the defaults keep their old
    values so nothing that renders today changes shape. A client that ignores
    the new field renders exactly as before; a client that reads it can say
    "I could not tell" instead of asserting a negative it does not know.

    THE STATE IS TAKEN, NOT DERIVED. ``registry.scan`` owns the vocabulary
    (its ``classify`` is the one place ``live``/``wedged``/``stale`` is
    decided) and the mapping below is total over those three words and nothing
    else. The heartbeat AGE comes from that same owner rather than from a
    second subtraction here, so the tooltip cannot disagree with the verdict
    about what a future-dated stamp means; the zombie probe is skipped because
    the verdict has already been reached and a second ``ps`` fork per row per
    poll would buy nothing.

#: Rows the poll materialises. The sidebar paints a fixed window (~38 rows at a
#: usual height) and pages within what it holds, so the untruncated answer
#: `/resume` wants is waste here: on a 665-directory store the poll built 56
#: rows every 2 s and spent 92-99% of itself doing it. Headroom well past the
#: viewport keeps paging and ranking honest without materialising the tail.
CATALOG_SCAN_LIMIT = 200

#: Newest subagent runs the sidebar's ⌥ layer lists when it is switched on.
#: One screenful of headroom past the ~38-row window, matching the reasoning
#: behind CATALOG_SCAN_LIMIT. No paging: the layer answers "what just ran".
#:
#: WHAT THIS CAP DOES AND DOES NOT BOUND. The cap bounds the PAGE, not the
#: selection. The per-row reads on the capped page — `origin.json` and
#: `session_created_at` — are O(cap): measured flat at 85 `origin.json` reads
#: with the hidden population at 50, 100, 400 and 800. What is NOT capped is
#: the step-2 selection sweep in `load_catalog`, which stats every hidden
#: directory to find the newest CAP of them: that is O(hidden population),
#: linear at a stable ~6.0 µs/dir measured from 250 to 4000 dirs, and it is
#: the term that scales.
#:
#: So the ON-path delta grows with the store, not with this constant. The
#: +6.6 ms measured today was ruled ACCEPTED-with-documentation rather than a
#: regression because the original +2.7 ms budget was set on a 462-hidden
#: store and the store outgrew it — the sweep is the prescribed algorithm
#: costing what it costs at a larger population, not a leak of the capped
#: reads into the population. Memoizing the sweep is the follow-up, and it
#: becomes worth its own invalidation surface at roughly 2,000 hidden
#: directories (~12 ms, 0.6% of the 2 s poll), not before.
#:
#: The ruling, with the measurements: `BRIEF-sidebar-slice-b.md`,
#: "## Lead check — round 1".
SUBAGENT_LAYER_CAP = 40

#: `session_id -> ((activity_mtime, transcript_size), SessionRow)`. A row's
#: name and fork mark change only when its transcript does, and the scan
#: already stats that file to rank the session, so the key is free. Only the
#: DURABLE fields are cached: `live_state`, `pending`, `wakes` and `unseen` are
#: layered on afterwards by `decorate_rows`/attention on every poll, because
#: caching a live fact would freeze the list.
_ROW_CACHE: dict[Path, tuple[tuple[float, int], SessionRow]] = {}

#: ``sessions root -> {session_id: ((st_ino, st_mtime_ns, st_size), birth)}`` for
#: ``created_at.json``. WHY: ``load_catalog`` must stamp EVERY candidate's birth
#: before ranking (the rank key is ``-created_at``, and no cheaper bound on it is
#: sound: activity can precede a hand-edited, restored or ``st_birthtime``
#: fallback birth, and a bounded selection then drops the row from the page --
#: PR #1470 review round 1, F1/Q-1). The open+read+parse per candidate was
#: 0.80 s of a 1.47 s desktop list at 9,400 directories (D-F7). The sidecar is
#: write-once by contract (#800), so a birth read on one poll is still true on
#: the next unless the file itself changed -- and one ``stat`` says whether it
#: did. The value served is always ``session_created_at``'s own answer.
#:
#: THE KEY is the sidecar's inode, nanosecond mtime and size. The one writer
#: (``creation.ensure_session_created_at``) publishes through a hard link of a
#: fresh temp file, so every rewrite is a new inode; a hand edit or replacement
#: moves mtime (and usually size and inode); a deleted-and-recreated directory
#: gets a new inode; a renamed directory is a different id. The accepted blind
#: spot is an in-place rewrite that keeps the same inode, the same size AND
#: restores the same nanosecond mtime (``touch -r`` after editing) -- served
#: stale until the process restarts or the file changes again.
#:
#: NOT CACHED: a directory with no readable sidecar -- absent, OR present but
#: unparseable (``null``, a bare string, ``true``, torn JSON). Its birth then
#: comes from ``origin.json`` or ``st_birthtime`` (``creation.session_created_at``),
#: files this key does not watch, so it is read every time -- the same cost as
#: before, for the ~0.4% of directories measured without one (39 of 9,725).
#: Only a value parsed FROM the watched file is ever cached (PR #1470 review
#: round 2, F2: caching the fallback served a stale ``origin.json`` birth, and
#: missed a corrupt sidecar repaired in place to the same inode/size/mtime).
#:
#: BOUNDED: each ``load_catalog`` call prunes its root's map to that call's
#: candidates, so a map holds at most one entry per visible session of the
#: store (648 on the reporting store; 10,000 on a 10k store of visible
#: sessions), and deleted or newly hidden sessions drop out on the next call.
#: At most :data:`_BIRTH_MEMO_ROOTS` roots are kept, oldest evicted first, so a
#: process that lists many stores (the test suite) cannot grow it without limit.

    and the fork-title probe, on rows whose transcript has not been appended to

    it is the scan's own set, handed on, and the caller may pass it straight to
    ``subagent_population(directory, known=...)`` or use it directly. A caller
    that only wants rows calls :func:`load_catalog`, which is this function's
    first value.

    Discovery already stats the whole namespace. Applying a recency cap before
    attention lost old unread work; reading names for the entire store would
    undo the sidebar's bounded I/O. Rank cheap rows first, then hydrate only the
    requested prefix through the existing transcript-stat cache.

    STRICT ABOUT THE STORE, TOLERANT ABOUT THE DECORATION, and the difference is
    deliberate. This is the listing a UI ADOPTS AS MEMBERSHIP — the desktop
    sidebar replaces the rows it is showing with this answer, and the TUI's sets
    its entries from it — so a store that exists but cannot be walked raises
    (:class:`SessionStoreUnavailable`, which the desktop route answers as a
    retryable 503) rather than being reported as "you have no conversations".
    Decorations are the opposite case: they never change WHICH rows are
    returned, only what is claimed about them, so a read that fails here is
    named on each row's ``degraded`` and the listing still stands.

    ``include_subagents`` adds a capped page of the hidden subagent population
    as a SEPARATE layer, and ``pinned_hidden_ids`` keeps individually pinned
    hidden sessions resolvable while that layer is off. Both are keyword-only
    and default to the behaviour every existing caller already has: with the
    layer off this function issues exactly the syscalls it did before.

    ``include_archived`` asks the same question of the OTHER visibility axis,
    and it is off by default because this listing IS a default listing: an
    archived conversation is hidden everywhere a user browses and is still
    resumable by explicit id. The filter itself lives in ``_scan_sessions``,
    which every listing surface reaches through, so the sidebar, the picker,
    the desktop catalogue and the search cannot disagree about which
    conversations exist to be offered.

    THE PINS FOLLOW THE SAME RULE, which is the case worth stating because it is
    the one a reader will look for: an archived session that is PINNED is not
    offered here, so it cannot appear in a sidebar's pinned section — and it
    also does not become a PHANTOM there, because ``pinned_off_page`` resolves
    ids out of the ranked list this function already filtered. The pin store is
    untouched, so un-archiving restores the row to its section.
    ``pinned_off_page`` keeps individually pinned sessions resolvable when the
    PAGE does not carry them — the same promise ``pinned_hidden_ids`` makes on
    the other axis, and a different one: a hidden id is absent because the
    catalogue never built it, while an off-page id IS built here and is dropped
    by the ``limit`` slice below. A caller that renders a pinned section must
    have both, because a pin is a durable statement by the user and a recency
    window is a property of the listing. The extras come back APPENDED, after
    the page and in the ranking's own order (every extra ranks below every page
    row by construction, so the concatenation IS rank order).
