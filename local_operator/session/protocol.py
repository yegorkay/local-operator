"""Session public API contract.

Implemented by ``local_operator.session.session.Session`` (stream A) and
programmed against by the TUI (stream D), exec mode (stream E), and the
server facade (integration). Keeping the surface as a Protocol lets the UI
and headless modes build and test against a fake session before the real one
lands.

Event delivery semantics: ``subscribe`` handlers receive
``AgentEvent`` instances in emission order; a handler may be sync or async.
``agent_end`` may arrive AFTER a subsequent ``agent_start`` when a turn was
superseded — UIs must handle that (see docs/REWRITE.md, stream D).

    A manual trigger can be pressed in states the automatic gate never sees (a

    already compacted), so "did not run" is a first-class answer that has to
    carry WHY: a host that cannot tell a refusal from a no-op reproduces the
    bug where ``/compact`` silently changed nothing.

    ``reason`` is the stable code (``already_running``, ``turn_running``,
    ``disabled``, ``nothing_to_compact``, ``cut_not_replayable``,
    ``below_threshold``, ``unavailable``, ``failed``); ``detail`` is the

    than in each host so the TUI, exec mode and the server cannot each invent
    their own wording for the same refusal.

    ``tokens_before`` is the figure the compaction gate acted on —
    ``max(provider-reported context, local estimate)`` — so the receipt agrees
    with the status band the user was just looking at. ``tokens_after`` is
    ``tokens_before`` minus the pass's saving, where the saving is the

        instruction. False is the caller's declaration that it supplied its OWN

        It is NOT free: the request carries the whole conversation. Nothing is
        recorded, so ``on_usage`` reports the provider's own figures to

        and an aside may make two — when the answer was a bare tool call with
        no text, the implementation retries once without tools — so a host

@runtime_checkable
class ViewerSessionProtocol(SessionProtocol, Protocol):
    """The surface a VIEWER offers on top of :class:`SessionProtocol`.

    A viewer is a facade attached to a runtime that executes turns somewhere
    else. It cannot run the loop, but it can do things a runtime has no need
    to do: page a display window it did not build, ask the runtime to stop,
    adopt a takeover, report which build the runtime is running.

    **Why this is declared.** These members exist only on ``AttachedSession``,
    and its hosts reached all of them through ``getattr(session, "name", None)``
    duck-probes rather than through a type \u2014 roughly forty undeclared members
    at the time of writing, on the object the entire front end is written
    against. The exact figure is not maintained here: it is derived by
    ``tests/unit/session/test_viewer_protocol.py``, which recomputes the
    viewer-only set from the classes on every run, and quoting a constant in a
    file whose point is that the number is derived is how the constant becomes
    wrong. A rename on the facade or a typo in a probe string is invisible to
    pyright and surfaces as a silently missing capability at runtime, which is
    exactly how ``/info`` reported zero subagents for a session that had
    several (see ``AttachedSession.subagent_comms``).

    **Why it is a separate protocol and not more of SessionProtocol.**
    Runtimes genuinely do not have these members and should not be forced to grow
    no-op stubs for them; a stub that returns a plausible empty value is worse
    than an absent attribute, because the caller cannot tell "nothing to show"
    from "not this kind of session".

    **How the TUI reaches it.** Through ``tui/app.py::_is_viewer``, a
    ``TypeGuard[ViewerSessionProtocol]`` over the declared ``owns_runtime``
    predicate — NOT through ``isinstance`` against this class. The sixteen
    ``isinstance(session, AttachedSession)`` checks that preceded it became one
    predicate, and pyright narrows to this type inside every true branch, so
    the members below are statically checked at each of those call sites.

    **Why ``runtime_checkable`` is still on this class**, even though no
    production path performs an ``isinstance`` against it. The decorator is not
    here to be used at runtime by the app; it is what lets
    ``tests/unit/session/test_viewer_protocol.py`` assert conformance
    STRUCTURALLY — that ``AttachedSession`` satisfies this protocol and that
    ``Session`` does not, which is the property making the split meaningful
    rather than decorative. Those assertions run once per test, never on a
    paint path.

    It is deliberately not used for dispatch, and the reason is measured rather
    than stylistic. This protocol carries 130 public members and a POSITIVE
    ``isinstance`` walks every one of them; measured on an arm64 host, CPython
    3.12.13, min-of-seven over 2,000 iterations:

    The figure is ``len(typing._get_protocol_attrs(ViewerSessionProtocol))`` —
    exactly the set a positive ``isinstance`` walks, which is what makes it the
    right number to quote beside the timing. It counts INHERITED members too,
    so it is larger than the viewer-only population
    ``test_viewer_protocol.py`` pins; the two answer different questions and
    must not be reconciled. It read 84 for some time while the protocol grew
    past it (106 before the warm members were added, 108 with them, 109 once
    ``restored_search_spend`` joined ``restored_usage``, 111 once
    ``can_ever_bind`` and ``session_was_stopped`` joined the viewer contract,
    ``can_ever_bind`` and ``session_was_stopped`` joined the viewer contract,
    112 once the lease-warm retry needed ``recovering``, 113 once
    ``restored_spend`` joined the shared surface a viewer inherits, 114 once
    session code memory joined the session contract with ``variables_op``, 115
    once the retention predicate's clone-free ``has_running_job`` joined the
    per-frame reads, 116 once ``mcp_credentials_op`` joined
    ``ViewerSessionProtocol``, 117 once a move needed the viewer's own ``cwd``,
    118 once the same move needed ``supports_exclusive_move`` so a desktop host
    can fail CLOSED against an owner that would ignore the exclusivity flag, 119
    once it needed the ``set_local_cwd_callback`` seam the move's local
    replacement is published through, 120 once the drain notice's
    ``set_drain_callback`` joined the viewer contract, 121 once the desktop's
    interrupt rung needed ``interrupt`` to stop a turn without ending the
    session, 122 once the same rung needed ``owner_reachable`` so a mid-resync
    viewer could not be read as an absent owner, 124 once a read had to report
    WHY it served cold — ``cold_reason`` and ``attaching``, one rung that adds
    two members because the wire tells a renderer both the fact and the
    in-flight state, 125 once a refused gate reply needed a surface to reach the
    pane that pressed APPROVE, 126 once the operator-prompt notice gave that pane
    the sentence naming what a signature is about to authorise, 127 once a
    paint-first open needed ``attach_behind`` to narrate the attach behind its
    paint, 128 once an answer that was accepted at the pane and never reached its
    owner needed a surface to say so (``set_gate_undelivered_handler``), 129
    once the dock band needed ``frontend_revision`` to skip a roster
    re-derivation nothing moved under, 130 once the desktop withdrawal needed
    ``withdraw_desktop_watch``), so
    recompute it rather
    than adjusting it by the size of your own change.

    ====================================================  ==================
    ``isinstance(viewer, AttachedSession)`` (what it was)    0.014-0.015 us
    ``isinstance(viewer, ViewerSessionProtocol)``            55-58 us
    ``not session.owns_runtime`` (what it is now)          0.021-0.024 us
    ====================================================  ==================

    THE ABSOLUTE IS THE PORTABLE FACT; the ratio is an order of magnitude and
    should be quoted as one (~10^3x). The positive reproduced across three
    independent hosts at 55-58 us, but the same three computed ratios of
    ~2,400x, ~1,500-1,690x and ~930-1,054x from it — because the sub-100 ns
    denominator is dominated by the timing loop rather than by the work. One
    host measured an empty-lambda floor of 0.018 us, 34% of its own predicate
    reading, and floor-subtracting moved its ratio to ~1,641x. So a narrow band
    here is a property of whoever last ran it: state the microseconds, which
    travel, and let the ratio carry only the magnitude, which is all the
    decision needs. (The negative case is cheap, ~1-3 us: it fails on the first
    missing member. Only the positive path pays, and the sites below are
    overwhelmingly positive.)

    **HOW to re-measure, because the obvious method silently measures the wrong
    path.** Only a FULLY CONSTRUCTED ``AttachedSession`` is a positive here — the
    cost is 84 property getters actually executing, so anything cheaper to build
    is cheaper to check for the wrong reason:

    ==========================================  =========  ==========
    construction                                positive?  measured
    ==========================================  =========  ==========
    ``AttachedSession(config_dir=..., ...)``       **yes**    ~55 us
    ``AttachedSession.__new__(AttachedSession)``     no         ~15 us
    ``MagicMock(spec=AttachedSession)``            no         ~3 us
    a synthetic class from ``__protocol_attrs__``  no       ~1-2 us
    ==========================================  =========  ==========

    Each of the bottom three looks like a viewer and reports a figure one to two
    orders of magnitude low, because it is timing the negative path that exits
    on the first missing member. So **assert the positive before timing it** —
    ``assert isinstance(v, ViewerSessionProtocol)`` — or the number produced is
    an answer to a different question. This cost a round-1 reviewer three
    attempts and produced one re-measurement (~7.5 us) that could not be
    reproduced by two others; the earlier 60-136 us figure quoted here was
    likewise never reproduced and has been replaced by the measurement above.

    Three of the converted sites are hot — the sidebar release sweep runs per
    source per pass, ``_relaunch_refusal`` loops every interaction — so
    dispatching on the type would put three orders of magnitude on a paint path
    to buy a guarantee the ``TypeGuard`` already provides statically.

    Headless hosts need this surface too, which is why it lives here rather
    than in the TUI: ``server/utils/desktop_sessions.py`` already imports,
    types against, and constructs ``AttachedSession`` to serve history pages.

    The member list is not curated by hand \u2014 it is derived by AST from every
    session-valued attribute access in ``tui/app.py`` and asserted complete by
    ``tests/unit/session/test_viewer_protocol.py``, which fails when a new
    undeclared duck-typed member appears.

    # --- what kind of viewer this is --------------------------------------
    @property
    def is_cold(self) -> bool:
        """Whether NO synchronised runtime is reachable through this viewer.

        True in two distinct situations, and callers depend on it covering
        BOTH:

        * never bound \u2014 a session id and a transcript but nothing executing:
          `lop` launched, the user opened the picker, nothing typed;
        * bound and now unreachable \u2014 the socket dropped, the runtime
          died, or the facade is redialing a replacement.

        The implementation is "no client, or not connected, or not ready for
        events", so the second case is deliberate rather than incidental.
        ``app.py:23470`` states the dependency outright ("``is_cold`` is a
        superset of the drop: it is also true while the facade is redialing a
        runtime that died"), and narrowing it to "never bound" would silently
        re-open the #625 shape at that site.

        So it does NOT distinguish never-bound from lost. A caller needing
        that reads ``degraded_reason`` or ``runtime_pid``; a caller asking
        "is a turn reachable right now" wants exactly this.
        """

    @property
    def can_ever_bind(self) -> bool:
        """Whether a bind attempt on this viewer could EVER succeed.

        Its own question, and not a refinement of :attr:`is_cold`. A facade is
        cold for many reasons that all clear on their own — a socket blip, an
        owner loss the recovery loop is already chasing, a never-bound row that
        has not been asked to dial yet, a live owner whose display history is
        mid-refresh — and every one of those binds or syncs. This asks the one
        thing a caller cannot wait out: whether the viewer is closed to dialling
        BY CONSTRUCTION, with nothing reachable on the other end.

        It is therefore NOT the negation of the guard at the top of
        ``AttachedSession._ensure_bound``, which returns in states this answers
        True for (a mid-refresh client, a facade with a recovery loop running).
        False is that guard with no live owner behind it:

        * the LEGACY attach contract (``_can_go_cold`` false, what ``connect``
          builds unless a caller asks for the viewer contract) once its owner is
          gone. That facade never dials, and what normally releases it is its
          own recovery loop (``_give_up_recovery`` sets the flag before going
          cold). A DELIBERATE stop is both the arm where no loop ever runs —
          ``_on_disconnected`` returns before starting one, and
          ``_recover_runtime`` returns instead of giving up when its own wake
          marker says the session was stopped — and the arm where nothing sets
          the flag, so the state is permanent;
        * a DISPOSED facade, which refuses every path.

        ``_recovering`` must answer True, and the distinction is load-bearing:
        the flag means "a recovery loop is running", and every exit of that loop
        either attaches this facade or releases it rebindable, so the state is
        transient by construction. A caller that treated it as final would tell
        the user that a session on its way back is gone.

        **Why this is DECLARED rather than probed.** The caller that needs it
        uses the answer to choose a sentence the user reads, which is exactly
        where a ``getattr(session, "_can_go_cold", None)`` duck-probe belongs:
        that is how the original sidebar defect shipped — a private read nothing
        type-checks, and a rename on the facade could not break it loudly. The
        name answers the question the caller has, not the flag it reads, so a
        future second reason to be un-bindable does not put a second name in
        every host.

          far more common case below, and the distinction is why the map is not
          simply a list of epochs.
        * VALUE — when it started, or ``None`` when the start carried no epoch
          (a legacy producer, an older runtime). An epoch-less start is present
          with ``None`` rather than absent: the event DOES say the call began,
          and the value is withheld instead of guessed, so consumers keep the

    # --- engine state a viewer host renders --------------------------------
    #
    # The MCP status segment and its menus, the subagent and job views, the
    # sidebar's gate identity, the wake panel, the ``/agent`` and ``/team``
    # listings, and the saved-usage band. These live on THIS protocol rather
    # than on ``SessionProtocol`` because that is where the duck-typed readers
    # land. BOTH
    # classes implement them — the owner exposes the live manager, scheduler or
    # registry, and a viewer a read-only SNAPSHOT the runtime published — and
    # every host that reaches them through a DUCK-TYPED binding holds an
    # attached facade: the TUI's ``self._session`` / ``source.session``, the
    # desktop routes' ``bridge.remote``, and ``info/collect.py``'s ``session``
    # parameter.
    #
    # The OWNER-side readers of these same members are NOT an exception to that.
    # ``harness/subagent.py`` types its ``parent_session`` as ``Session`` and
    # reads ``mcp_manager`` / ``mcp_startup`` / ``jobs`` off it, so pyright is
    # already checking those against the real class.
    #
    # ``session/runtime/serving.py`` reads ``self._session.jobs`` on the owner
    # too, and those reads are UNCHECKED: ``ServingSessionHandle.__init__``
    # takes ``session: Any``, so ``self._session`` is ``Any`` there and pyright
    # verifies nothing — not against the real class, not against a protocol.
    # Restating the difference matters because it is the reason a declaration on
    # ``SessionProtocol`` would buy those readers nothing either: what would
    # check them is typing the handle's constructor, not widening the protocol.
    # Either way the placement is a claim about the DUCK-TYPED population and
    # not the claim "only a viewer has these".
    #
    # Declaring them is deliberately NOT the same as making them safe for any
    # host to read. A snapshot member answers from the last sync, so a caller
    # that needs the live object — or the owner-only extra argument, as
    # ``subscribe_frontend``'s ``display_window`` is — must hold the concrete
    # engine type. What the declaration buys is that a rename, a typo or a
    # deletion is now a pyright error and a guard failure instead of the silent
    # ``None`` that shipped a fabricated zero-subagent ``/info``.
    #
    # The wider-protocol claim is not hypothetical: declaring these on
    # ``SessionProtocol`` would add only conformance obligations — the duck-typed
    # hosts read the same members either way — and it put the whole
    # ``tests/unit/tui`` double population off conformance (measured: 213
    # pyright errors across 19 files, from ~10 reduced local ``FakeSession``
    # classes alone; 1996 when every member of the old exclusion list went
    # there). A double that has to grow an MCP manager to keep compiling is a
    # double describing an object the hosts never read. The viewer protocol is
    # the narrower claim, it is true of every duck-typed reader above, and it
    # costs the doubles nothing.

class GoalRecordProtocol(Protocol):
    """The judged-goal RECORD's owner-side surface — the ``Session``'s, not a viewer's.

    Why this is neither :class:`SessionProtocol` nor :class:`ViewerSessionProtocol`,
    which is the only interesting question about it:

    * Not on ``SessionProtocol``, because four of these members MUTATE the record
      (``arm_goal``, ``mark_goal_done``, ``delete_goal``, ``dismiss_goal``) and a
      follower must never write the owner's goal — that is the second-writer
      class the ownership rule (``goal_judge.owns_the_session``) exists to
      prevent. A protocol is a promise, and promising every ``SessionProtocol``
      implementation the right to settle someone else's goal would be a false
      one. ``isinstance`` on a ``runtime_checkable`` protocol checks member
      PRESENCE, so declaring them here would also make the facade claim to have
      them when it does not.
    * Not on ``ViewerSessionProtocol``, because the TUI reaches these through
      ``self._session``, which may hold either kind — and pyright would then
      still (correctly) refuse the reads on the owner's own session.

    So it is a THIRD, owner-side protocol, and a host narrows to it deliberately:
    ``isinstance(session, GoalRecordProtocol)`` is False on an attached facade,
    which is the truthful answer to "is this session's goal mine to write?".

    **A follower is not left without the acts.** It reaches all four by the
    ROUTED slash command — ``/goal`` is not in ``frontend_state``'s
    ``_FRONTEND_LOCAL_SLASHES``, so the follower's ``/goal --clear``/``--done``/
    ``--dismiss`` runs on the owner and comes back as the owner's own receipt
    (``tui/app.py::_goal_slash_result``). Adding routed implementations of these
    four to ``AttachedSession`` would be a SECOND path to the same acts beside
    that established one, which is why the facade is left alone here.

    What it covers and why: the five members the TUI calls DIRECTLY (pyright
    reported twelve attribute errors for them against ``SessionProtocol``), plus
    the record's read side and the judge's journal writer, which the TUI reaches
    through delibate ``getattr`` probes with follower-safe defaults. Those probes
    stay probes — a viewer rendering an empty card for a record it cannot see is
    the honest outcome — but the names they spell must still be declared
    somewhere, or a rename degrades to a silent ``None``
    (``tests/unit/session/test_viewer_protocol.py`` is the guard that says so,
    and it knows this protocol by name).
