"""Session directory liveness: who owns a session directory right now.

THIS MODULE NEVER DELETES ANYTHING. It used to. Three generations of
"safe" automatic cleanup lived here — age/count/byte ceilings, then an
empty-directory reaper, then an "unused session" backfill (#576) that
removed any directory whose transcript held no ``"role": "user"`` row —
and the last of them destroyed 225 of an operator's 244 named sessions
(296,617 model calls of history) in one night. Its opt-out setting was
written under a nested key and read under a flat one, so the toggle the
user was offered did nothing. The runtime exit path carried a fourth
deleter (``_remove_unwritten_session_dir``, #622) with the same production
evidence.

The invariant this module now states and the test suite enforces
(``tests/unit/session/test_no_session_deletion.py``): **no code path
outside** :mod:`local_operator.session.cleanup` **removes, renames or
replaces a directory under** ``sessions/``. Cleanup is one explicit policy,
OFF by default, that a user turns on in ``/settings`` or runs by hand with
``lop sessions cleanup``. Nothing here — no sweep, no startup hook, no
exit hook, no daemon — deletes a session on its own judgement, whatever
the directory holds, however old it is, however many siblings it has.

What survives here is the CLAIM: a starting session writes a liveness
marker (:func:`claim_session`) naming its pid, and drops it on dispose
(:func:`release_session`). The marker exists so that anything that scans
the store — the cleanup policy when the user enables it, the resume
picker, the mobile daemon — can tell "a live process owns this" from "a
dead run left this behind" without guessing. :func:`_is_claimed` answers
that question and :func:`_process_alive` is the shared liveness probe
(``tools/group_reaper.py`` imports it so the two never disagree).

#:   read as idle for 0.0007 days, ``max_inactive_days`` became a no-op and

    means the id IS taken (by another user's process), so it counts as alive —
    "alive" is always the safe answer for a caller deciding whether a
    directory is in use.

    Windows has no signal 0 — ``os.kill`` there TERMINATES the target — so the
