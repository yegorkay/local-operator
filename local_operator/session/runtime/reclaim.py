"""The external residency sweep: end the session runtimes nothing can reach.

**WHY THIS EXISTS, in two measurements.** On 2026-09-17 this machine ran 57-61
session runtimes. **34 of them had no discovery record in the operator's own
store** (``~/.local-operator/run/mobile`` — what ``lop sessions``, ``lop send``,
attach and the desktop app all read), the oldest had been alive 11.3 h, and
between them they held ~810 MB of RSS that no surface in the product could name.
The second measurement is the one that changes what to do about them: asking each
process for the config root it ACTUALLY uses (``ps -Eww``) found every one holding
a heartbeat-fresh record in its OWN root — sibling QA stores under ``/tmp`` and
``/private/tmp``, 32 of the 36 publishing ``busy: true``. So the population is not
a set of corpses: it is runtimes of other stores that this store cannot see, and a
sweep scoped to one store has no business ending any of them. Both facts are why
this module exists and why its refusals are as wide as they are: the census is
what makes such a runtime NAMABLE (`roster`), and the refusal ladder is what keeps
the sweep from ending a runtime another store is still using.

**THE ONE PROCESS IT CAN END IS THE ONE NOTHING CAN REACH.** A candidate is a
running process whose command line is the session runtime's own
(``-m local_operator.session.runtime.process``), whose own config root — read from
its environment, not assumed — is either the root being swept or a path that NO
LONGER EXISTS. Everything else is refused: a runtime of a live sibling root is its
own root's business (that root's supervisor sees it and can sweep it), and a
machine-wide sweep that ended it would be reaching across a boundary it cannot see
the far side of. A root that is gone is the one case with no such far side at all:
no client, viewer, wake or supervisor of that root can exist, because every one of
them resolves through a path that is gone. (A runtime whose store is merely
deleted often recreates it — ``registry.publish`` makes the directories it needs —
so this class is the store that CANNOT be written: a gone mount, a read-only
volume, a replaced path. Measured: a plain deletion holds for under 15 s.)

**HOW THE SWEEP KNOWS A CANDIDATE IS IDLE — it does not, and it does not have to.**
The sweep never forces an exit. It sends **SIGTERM**, whose handler in the runtime
is work-aware by construction (``process.amain``'s ``_on_signal``): with nothing in
flight it leaves immediately, and with a turn, a compaction, a subagent or a
parked gate in flight it COMMITS to leaving and finishes that work first, bounded
by ``types.SIGNAL_DRAIN_S`` (120 s). So a runtime that is mid-turn is not cut off
by a sweep — it finishes its turn and then leaves, which is exactly the behaviour
``lop stop``'s second rung already relies on. SIGKILL is deliberately absent from
this module and no escalation rung exists: an unrefusable signal is the one thing
that could destroy a turn, and nothing here needs it.

What the sweep DOES establish, for every candidate, is that nothing outside can be
depending on that runtime right now:

* **No record ⇒ no attach, no send, no engage.** A runtime publishes its discovery
  record before it listens and keeps it while it works; attach, `lop send`, the
  desktop roster and the wake supervisor's own engage path all resolve a runtime
  through that record. A record-less runtime cannot be reached, and cannot be given
  new work by anything.
* **The record's absence is CONFIRMED over a window** (:data:`CONFIRM_S`), from two
  independent sightings of the process table, and any record that appears in
  between drops the candidate. That is what makes the sweep unable to race an
  attach that has not happened yet: an attach is possible only through a record,
  and a record that exists at confirm time is a refusal (``record-present``).
* **Nothing is attached to it either.** A live viewer lease naming its session, or
  an ESTABLISHED connection to its control port (from the machine's own socket
  table, when ``lsof`` is available), is a refusal: something is looking at it.
* **It is not merely still booting.** A candidate younger than
  :data:`MIN_AGE_S` is refused, which covers the whole construction window of a
  spawn whose record is not published yet (measured at 2.1 s warm, and the engage
  deadline the supervisor sizes for is 180 s). The age is the YOUNGER of the
  process's own and its boot record's (:func:`effective_age`), because an adopted
  runtime's interpreter is started minutes before the session it constructs.
* **It is not burning CPU.** Cumulative CPU is compared across the two sightings
  and a candidate that spent more than :data:`BUSY_CPU_FRACTION` of the window
  burning is refused for another window. This test can only ever REFUSE — a quiet
  runtime may still be waiting on a model API call, so low CPU proves nothing —
  and it exists so the one candidate class the sweep ends is never a runtime that
  is visibly doing work. It needs a window long enough to mean anything, which is
  :data:`MIN_ACTIONABLE_CONFIRM_S`: below it the floor dominates the fraction and
  the rung cannot fire whatever the runtime does, so a caller may not ask for one.
* **It is still the process the pass decided about.** The census and the fleet are
  read once at the top of a pass and the signal goes out later — measured on this
  host, 19 ms to 1161 ms later across a real 74-row census — so the candidate's own
  row is re-read immediately before ``os.kill`` and the signal is withheld if the
  pid was recycled, changed its argv, moved to another root or published a record
  in the interval (:func:`target_changed`).

**PARENTAGE IS NOT EVIDENCE, IN EITHER DIRECTION.** A session runtime is spawned
detached (``start_new_session=True``), so ``ppid=1`` is the NORMAL state of a
healthy runtime whose spawner has moved on, and it is equally the state of the
orphans this module exists for. A dead parent therefore says nothing about whether
a runtime is wanted, and nothing here keys on it.

**WHAT IT WILL NOT DO.** It never signals this process or any of its ancestors
(a sweep started from inside a session must not end that session). It never
touches a record — reading is all it does to ``run/mobile`` and ``run/host``
(``reap=False`` throughout), because a sweep that reaped evidence while deciding
would destroy the answer to "why did this die". And it never ends a runtime it
cannot attribute to a root.

**AND IT DOES NOTHING WHEN ITS EVIDENCE IS INCOMPLETE.** If the machine's socket
table cannot be read — no ``lsof``, or it timed out — then the refusal that lives
only there (a client attached to a record-less runtime's control port) cannot be
evaluated, and the pass refuses the candidates it would otherwise admit
(:data:`REFUSAL_SOCKETS_UNKNOWN`) rather than signalling through the gap. The
consequence is that the sweep reclaims NOTHING on such a machine, which is the
posture this module's own test file states: a sweep that ends one runtime it
should not have is worse than a sweep that reclaims nothing. The report carries
``sockets_available=False``, the CLI prints it and the roster's ``socket_table``
says so, so the reason is never a mystery.

The module is stdlib-only and off the model-facing path by the same contract as
``registry`` and ``viewers``: the wake supervisor imports it, and the supervisor's
whole justification is staying cheap.

# halves cannot drift into a census that silently matches nothing. It is
# matched as a whole argv word after a ``-m``, never as a substring: a human
# running ``grep local_operator.session.runtime.process`` (or this module's own
# tests) would otherwise appear in the census as a runtime.

#: How old a record-less runtime must be before a sweep may consider it. Sized
#: against the spread of the spawn path rather than against its median: the
#: measured cold engage publishes a record in 2.1 s warm and 5.1 s resuming a
#: 34 MB transcript, but the wake supervisor's own engage deadline — the budget a
#: cold runtime is allowed to take before its record is expected — is 180 s. 300 s
#: is that budget plus a wide margin, and it is spent as a delay on a process that
#: is already invisible rather than as a risk to a process that is still booting.
MIN_AGE_S = 300.0

#: The minimum separation between the two sightings a reclaim decision needs.
#: Long enough that a record written by a just-arriving attach is seen (the

#: record immediately), and short enough that a real orphan is gone within a
#: couple of passes on a 60 s cadence.
CONFIRM_S = 60.0

#: The CPU share of the confirm window above which a candidate is refused for
#: another window. A ONE-WAY TEST: a healthy idle runtime measures 0.0-0.3 % of a
#: core lifetime on this machine, while the two runtimes that were observed
#: mid-work measured 22.8 % and 77.0 %, so 2 % separates "visibly working" from
#: "quiet" with a wide margin. It cannot acquit anything — a runtime waiting on a
#: model API call is quiet — which is why the acquittal comes from the SIGTERM
#: drain above and this test only ever removes a candidate from the pass.
BUSY_CPU_FRACTION = 0.02

#: The shortest confirm window in which the CPU rung can still fire at all, and
#: therefore the shortest window a caller may ASK FOR.
#:
#: Derived rather than restated, because the two constants above are what make a
#: window meaningful: the budget is ``max(BUSY_CPU_FLOOR_S, BUSY_CPU_FRACTION *
#: elapsed)``, so below ``BUSY_CPU_FLOOR_S / BUSY_CPU_FRACTION`` the floor
#: dominates and the measured fraction can never reach it whatever the runtime
#: does. QA round 1 (Q2) measured the consequence end to end: at
#: ``--confirm-s 0`` a process that had burned 90.4 s of CPU (6.30 s per 60 s
#: against a 1.2 s budget at the default window) was admitted and SIGTERMed,
#: because the window it was judged over was too short for the test to see it.
#: A window shorter than this is not a faster sweep — it is a sweep with no CPU
#: rung, which is one of the four rungs the safety argument is built from, so the
#: CLI refuses it rather than quietly dropping it (``cli._confirm_window``).
MIN_ACTIONABLE_CONFIRM_S = BUSY_CPU_FLOOR_S / BUSY_CPU_FRACTION

#: How long each external tool may take before the pass gives up on it. The
#: census and the socket table are read on a supervisor's slice, next to wakes
#: that are due; a wedged ``ps`` must cost one slice, not the loop.
CENSUS_TIMEOUT_S = 5.0
SOCKET_TIMEOUT_S = 3.0

#: How long a caller that watches (the CLI, and the evidence harness) waits for a
#: signalled runtime to actually leave. The drain it may have to finish is bounded

    that snapshot — measured on this host's real 74-row census: first SIGTERM
    19 ms after the pass began, last one **1161 ms** after. Two things can change
    inside that window and neither is visible to the ladder, because the ladder
    has already run:

    * **(a) the pid is recycled.** It exits and the kernel reuses the number; the
      signal then lands on a stranger. Nothing in the ladder can see the
      substitution — the ``young``/``foreign``/``self`` rungs were all evaluated
      against the EARLIER census. A runtime reusing the pid would be refused as
      ``young`` if it were re-read, but the hazard that survives is any OTHER
      process: a build, a test runner, a daemon, receiving SIGTERM.
    * **(b) a record appears.** A candidate whose record was deleted re-publishes
      on its next heartbeat, which makes it reachable — the exact race the
      confirm window exists to prevent, moved inside the pass. This one is
      contained by the runtime's work-aware SIGTERM drain, but it should not need
      to be.

    Both are closed here, by re-reading the ONE row immediately before the signal
    and refusing on any change: the pid must still exist and still be a runtime by
    its argv (:func:`process_row` returns ``None`` otherwise), it must not be
    YOUNGER than the row the pass measured (a recycled pid starts its life at
    zero), it must report the same config root (the attribution the verdict rests
    on), and there must be no discovery record for it now in any of ``roots``.

    Refusal, never a correction: this is not a second verdict and it can neither
    admit a candidate the ladder turned away nor rescue one it did not judge —
    only withhold a signal the snapshot authorised.
