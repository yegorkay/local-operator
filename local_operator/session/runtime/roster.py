"""The runtime roster: every live session runtime this machine has, reachable or not.

**WHAT IT ANSWERS.** "Is there a runtime for this session, where is it, and did it
answer?" — for EVERY runtime on the machine, in one bounded read. That question
had no answer before this module, and the gap was measured: on 2026-09-17, 34 of
57 live runtimes had no discovery record in any namespace, so every reader in the
product (``lop sessions``, ``lop send``, attach, the desktop app, the wake
supervisor) could not name them at all. Central reachability means a client must
be able to FIND and REACH any runtime without depending on a record, on one
particular port, or on any one process answering — which is why the roster is
composed from four independent sources and states, per row, which of them knew
about it.

**THE FOUR SOURCES, AND WHY EACH IS NEEDED.**

* ``run/mobile`` (via ``registry.scan``) — the discovery records: session id,
  control port, build, live state, heartbeat. The only source that can be
  ATTACHED to.
* ``run/host`` — the boot records: pid, session id, build, install root, parent.
  A boot-time snapshot rather than a liveness signal, so it is used for ATTRIBUTION
  (which session this pid was spawned for) and never for liveness.
* The process census (:mod:`reclaim`) — the process table, which is the only source
  that sees a runtime whose record and boot record are both gone. This is the one
  that makes the roster complete, and the row it produces is the one the operator's
  machine was full of.
* The machine's socket table — the control port of a record-less runtime (so it can
  be DIALED, not merely listed) and whether anything is connected to it right now.
  Read with one bounded ``lsof``, degrading to "unknown" rather than to "none".

Nothing that already works depends on this module. It is a reader: records and boot
records are read with ``reap=False``, the census and the socket table are read-only
external calls, and the only mutation any of it performs is the TCP connect of a
health probe.

**BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION.** The cost is O(live runtimes), one process-table fork
plus one batched zombie probe plus one socket-table call plus one bounded connect
per row that names a port. The whole composition runs on a worker thread (the
route hands it to ``asyncio.to_thread``), the probes run in a small fixed pool
with a short per-connect timeout, and the caller's budget is enforced as a
deadline: a row whose probe did not complete inside the budget is reported as
``unknown`` rather than waited for. A dead pid is never dialled at all —
``pid_alive`` (signal-0) answers first, and the row reads ``gone`` — so no wedged
or crashed runtime can make this endpoint hang.

**WHAT THE BUDGET DOES AND DOES NOT COVER.** ``budget_s`` bounds the PROBES — one
batch of loopback connects, abandoned when the deadline passes — and nothing else.
The response's real ceiling is ``budget_s + CENSUS_TIMEOUT_S +
SOCKET_TIMEOUT_S`` (2.5 s + 5 s + 3 s in the worst case, i.e. both external reads
wedged at their own timeouts, which is a machine whose process table and socket
table are both unresponsive). A small ``budget_s`` does not make the response
small: measured at ``budget_s=0.1`` the probe batch is abandoned at 0.1 s but the
``ps`` and ``lsof`` reads in front of it still cost what they cost (~0.14 s +
~0.26 s idle on the reference host, seconds when real load is present), and the
budget bounds only the part of this route that scales with the ROW COUNT — which
is the part that grows. Review round 1 (R1-4) measured the docstrings promising a
bound the code did not keep; this paragraph is the honest version.

    # would have said, and a store full of dead records is the case that costs
    # nothing. The alternative — ``pid_alive(pid, check_zombie=True)`` per row — is
