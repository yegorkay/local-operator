"""The session runtime: make a live session reachable over a control socket.

Every interactive ``lop`` process (the TUI, and ``exec`` when it runs
attached) hosts one of these. It does three things:

1. **Publishes** the discovery record (see :mod:`.registry`) and rewrites it
   on a heartbeat — cheap enough that a machine with no daemon installed
   pays nothing but one small file write every 15 seconds.
2. **Listens** on a random loopback port for control connections,
   authenticating each with the record's key (constant-time
   compare — the key is the whole credential).
3. **Bridges**: folds the session's event stream into the phone projection
   (:class:`~local_operator.mobile.projection.ProjectionFold`) and pushes a
   repaint on change; applies clients' requests to the session through a
   host-provided :class:`SessionHandle`.

This was ``mobile/registrant.py`` and the class was ``Registrant``. Nothing
about it is phone-specific except the projection fold, which is an injected
:class:`ProjectionSink` collaborator built lazily on the first daemon dial
when none is supplied: the phone daemon, an attach terminal, and — later —
wakes and background automations are all VIEWERS of one session runtime.
``Registrant`` remains as an alias at the bottom of this module and at the old
import path, so no call site had to change in the move.

The handle indirection exists because the two runtime kinds drive their
session differently: the TUI must route mutations through Textual's message
pump and thread (``call_from_thread``), while an exec-mode host can call the
session directly. The runtime speaks to the handle, never to Textual.

Threading: the control socket server runs on its own thread with its own
event loop — the TUI's loop must never block on a phone, and clients'
requests (model switches, aborts) must land even while the TUI is mid-repaint.
All session mutations funnel through the handle, whose contract is "callable
from the runtime's loop, serialized by the implementor".

    "sendable" drifts from a reader's "readable", the failure this whole family
    of guards exists to prevent.

    It is NOT yet the only spelling in the tree, and saying it was would be a
    claim this file cannot keep. ``session/frontend_state.py`` derives the same
    number inline twice — its result-envelope reserve, and ``oversized_frame_report``'s
    ``+1`` — against the very limit this module hands it as an argument, and it
    cannot import this name because ``runtime.server`` imports THAT module, so the
    import would close a cycle (its own comment at ``MODEL_CATALOGUE_FLOOR_ROWS``
    pins the value for exactly that reason). Nothing is broken today: the
    arithmetic is identical. Unifying those two onto one rule — by hosting it
    where both can import it — is a follow-up, not something this docstring can
    assert into being.

    Counting the newline is CONSERVATIVE, not a requirement of the readers. The
    boundary was probed against an asyncio ``StreamReader`` created with a buffer
    limit of ``L`` — the limit is a property of the reader (``open_connection(limit=…)``),
    not an argument to ``readline()``: a payload of exactly ``L`` bytes plus its
    ``\\n`` is RETURNED, and only a payload longer than ``L`` raises
    ``ValueError("Separator is found, but chunk is longer than limit")``. Keeping
    the delimiter in the count buys one byte of margin on a boundary where being
    wrong costs the whole connection, which is worth more than the byte; it is
    not a claim about where the limit sits.

    ``payload`` is for a caller that has ALREADY encoded the frame: ``_send_to``
    serializes to write, so measuring it here would serialize every frame twice
    on the per-client repaint path — measured at 2.3 ms for a 188 KB frame on

    key it writes, or a viewer resolves one shape and a resume the other.

    Returns ``(value_or_copy, moved)``. The input is NEVER mutated: one producer
    frame is handed to every recipient by :meth:`RuntimeServer._relay_on_loop`,

    what every later connection sends — and the later connection would then
    enqueue a reference for a frame nobody measured. Only the spine that
    actually changed is copied, which is ``filter_update_trajectories``'s

    An image block is identified by carrying a LONG ``data`` string alongside

    producer that emits ``mime_type`` is ``read``'s image path, which carries no
    ``data``. A future producer that puts a mime type beside a payload under
    ``data`` should expect this pass to see it as an image block.

    A store that refuses the write (read-only home, full disk) leaves the

    """Return ``frame`` prepared for the socket line, or the honest stand-in.

    WHY A FIT PASS IN FRONT OF THE GUARD. :func:`relay_frame_or_degraded` is
    honest but destructive: it sheds the WHOLE frame, so an oversized
    ``tool_execution_end`` never reaches the viewer, the live tool card never
    settles (``session/attached.py`` carries ``_pending_tool_ends`` and the
    ``⊘ interrupted`` fallback for exactly that stranded card), and the viewer
    falls back to a full re-sync. Measured on the operator's own session bytes
    (digest ``b8758f0a``, a 317,726-byte page render, base64 through the real
    store): one ``message`` with two of them serializes to an 847,600-byte
    frame, and two such rows to 1,695,113 bytes — 1.62x the 1 MiB line
    ``start_server(..., limit=_MAX_LINE_BYTES)`` enforces.

    The asymmetry that says this is the right layer: the DURABLE path already
    solved the shape. ``transcript._externalize_attachments`` moves any block
    over ``_ATTACHMENT_FLOOR_BYTES`` into the content-addressed store and leaves
    ``{"attachment": <digest>, "mime_type": ...}``, which every frontend
    already resolves — the desktop route, the phone daemon, and the resume path
    all read that key. The live event stream was the only route still shipping
    the base64.

    Ordered stages, cheapest first, each re-measured because each can be enough:

    1. Fits already -> returned UNCHANGED (identity), so the common path costs
       the single ``json.dumps`` it always cost.
    2. Image payloads moved to the attachment store, under the durable path's
       own key. Never partial: a store that refuses the write keeps the inline
       payload and the frame simply stays large.
    3. A payload-bearing ``tool_execution_end`` still oversized -> its result
       payloads bounded on a copy, so the EVENT survives to settle the card
       while only its payload is replaced by the existing honest marker.
    4. :func:`relay_frame_or_degraded`, unchanged in behaviour and authority and
       still the terminal step. Only a frame that is genuinely unfittable — an
       image-free oversize, a store that cannot be written, a payload the
       residual share cannot buy down — reaches it, and it still says so at
       ERROR because that is now an alarm rather than the normal path.

def relay_frame_or_degraded(frame: dict[str, Any], cap_bytes: int) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Return ``frame``, or a small stand-in when it cannot be read.

    WHY A FRAME THIS BIG IS NOT MERELY LARGE. The attach client dials with
    ``limit=_READ_LIMIT_BYTES`` (the same 1 MiB as ``cap_bytes``), so an
    oversized line makes its ``readline`` raise ``LimitOverrunError``. That is
    unrecoverable rather than lossy — not because the bytes stay in the buffer
    (``readline`` DRAINS them: it deletes through the separator when it found
    one and clears the buffer when it did not, the same fact ``_on_connection``'s
    INBOUND prose below depends on), but because a frame the client never sees whole is
    one it cannot apply: a relay frame is a delta carrying a sequence, and the
    client's own contract says resuming after a silent gap is drift. The pump
    therefore dies, and the viewer paints "owner sent a frame too large to
    read" — the message the operator hit — losing the whole connection over one
    delta. ``frontend_sync`` has been guarded since it caused exactly this
    (see ``oversized_frame_report``); ``frontend_update`` and ``event`` were
    not, and a single 1,039,374-byte transcript row produced a 1,129,319-byte
    ``event`` frame that killed the socket.

    DEGRADING ONE DELTA IS SAFE; KILLING THE SOCKET IS NOT. Both relay frame
    types are deltas over state the viewer can recover by other means: it holds
    durable history and re-syncs through ``frontend_sync``, which carries the
    canonical snapshot. Dropping the payload costs one animation step that the
    next snapshot supersedes. Killing the connection costs the session.

    THE STAND-IN MUST STILL BE A VALID FRAME OF ITS OWN OP, which is why this
    is not one generic placeholder:

    * ``event`` — the payload is deserialized by ``deserialize_event``, which
      REQUIRES ``type``. A bare marker raises there, and although the client
      swallows callback failures (so the pump survives), the viewer would then
      silently miss the frame with nothing said. It degrades to a ``notice``
      instead: a real event type, rendered, and honest about what happened.
    * ``frontend_update`` — canonical deltas are NOT replacement-safe. The
      client checks ``epoch``/``sequence`` and closes the connection on a gap
      by design, precisely so canonical state can never drift. A placeholder
      that dropped the sequence would trip that check and kill the connection
      this function exists to save, so the sequencing fields are carried
      through and only the oversized BODY is shed. The viewer sees a
      well-sequenced delta whose payload says it was degraded.

    Cost on the hot path: one ``json.dumps`` per frame, measured at ~48µs on a
    20 KB frame (about 41% of the send's own serialization). That is an
    ADDITIONAL serialization, not a reused one — the send does its own — and it
    is accepted deliberately: the alternative is a frame the viewer cannot read

#: is answered by a hook that tears this runtime down (see

#:
#: * ``watch`` / ``unwatch`` — gated to a REGISTERED DAEMON, and SILENTLY so:
#:   the arm runs only for ``conn.kind == "daemon"`` on a registered writer; an
#:   attach client's frame is accepted and changes nothing, deliberately, because
#:   only the daemon's count is ever cleared. Present here for the daemon's dial.
#: * ``watch_job`` / ``unwatch_job`` — NO SHAPE GATE AT ALL. The arm validates
#:   only that ``job_id`` is a non-empty string and then adds or discards it on
#:   this connection's own ``watched_jobs``; attach and daemon are treated
#:   identically.
#: * ``desktop_watch`` — REFUSED BY SHAPE: a registered ``kind == "attach"``
#:   connection whose ``surface == "desktop"``, plus boolean ``visible`` /
#:   ``can_notify``; anything else gets the error frame.
#: * ``desktop_withdraw`` — REFUSED BY SHAPE: a registered ``kind == "attach"``
#:   connection whose ``surface == "desktop"``; no fields are read. The
#:   bridge's explicit "the pane left" signal (the one frame that clears the
#:   session-scoped attach memory).
#: * ``viewer_watch`` — REFUSED BY SHAPE: a registered ``kind == "attach"``
#:   connection and a boolean ``displaying``.
#: * ``event_mute`` / ``event_unmute`` — REFUSED BY SHAPE: attach-only, because
#:   the relay they mute is never sent to a daemon at all.
#:
#: The dial path depends on the event mute, ``viewer_watch``,
#: ``desktop_watch`` and ``desktop_withdraw`` — four of the five

#: re-asserts (or, for the withdrawal, replays) right after the welcome,

_AUTHORITY_OPS = AUTHORITY_OPS

#: How long a minted challenge stays usable. Short on purpose (revision 2, §2.3
#: spells 30 s): the window between a surface asking for a challenge and signing
#: it is one human gesture, and a long window is a long time for a captured
#: challenge to be spent by somebody else. Expiry is checked at USE, not at mint,
#: so a challenge that outlives a slow prompt is refused rather than silently
#: honoured — the surface asks again, which costs one more prompt only in the
#: case where the first one took half a minute.
_CHALLENGE_TTL_S = 30.0

#: How many challenges one connection may hold. Bounded because minting is an
#: ordinary op and therefore unauthenticated beyond the record key: without a
#: cap, a same-uid child could mint challenges in a loop and grow this runtime's
#: memory without limit. Eight is far more than a real surface needs (it asks for
#: one per action, signs it, and consumes it).
_MAX_CHALLENGES_PER_CONN = 8

#: Bound on unspent challenges for the WHOLE runtime, not per connection.
#:
#: The per-connection cap alone is not a bound on a subject that can dial freely:
#: the session record's ``control_key`` — which is what the very predicate this op
#: exists for refuses to accept as authority — is readable by the subject, so it
#: can open as many connections as it likes and hold the per-connection maximum on
#: each (agent review round 6, R6-4). The design already accepts denial rather than
#: escalation from that subject, so this is not an escalation either; it is the
#: difference between a bounded and an unbounded one. Set well above any real
#: surface's need — one human gesture is one challenge — and expired entries are
#: pruned before it is consulted, so an idle runtime never refuses a real caller.
_MAX_LIVE_CHALLENGES = 64

#: How long a runtime may keep trusting the revocation list it read at first need.
#:
#: THE SAME OBJECT THE PRODUCT QUOTES, not a second literal that happens to agree
#: (agent review round 7, M-2). ``trust.ANCHOR_REFRESH_S`` is what the design doc
#: and `lop operator devices --revoke`'s receipt state to an operator, so a runtime
#: enforcing its own copy could tell someone a window it does not honour — a
#: security claim outrunning the code, which is the class this round exists to
#: remove. Bound here as a module attribute as well, because a test shrinks the
#: window to zero by patching ONE name and this is the name the cache is built from.
_ANCHOR_REFRESH_S = ANCHOR_REFRESH_S

#: How long a verified device certificate is remembered. The certificate is
#: checked lazily and per certificate string; a TTL rather than a permanent cache
#: because the anchor's revocation list can change under a long-running session.
_DEVICE_CERT_TTL_S = 300.0

#: Bound on the device-certificate cache. Keyed by an attacker-chosen string, so
#: an uncapped map is a memory leak with an on-demand trigger; clearing wholesale
#: on overflow is enough, because the entries are pure recomputable answers.

        #   2. second removal   `_drop_client` is documented to run TWICE on
        #                       one connection; an unconditional release on the
        #                       late call wiped the REPLACEMENT's live count
        #                       (R7).

        #                       still arrives after its connection is evicted,

        a caller that reads ``record.control_port`` (or ``record_path``) on the

        written. That is not theoretical: ``exec_control.start_exec_control``

        it is for. ``process.amain`` reads the record less eagerly (its parent
        polls ``launch.py``'s wait-for-record loop), but it asks for the same
        ordering and gets it from the same call rather than from a second

        prologue settled without publishing (a bind failure) or the bound
        expired. The two are ONE answer on purpose: both mean "there is no
        control surface to talk to", and a caller that needs to tell them apart
        has the runtime's own log for it.

        IT SETTLES AT THE END OF THE BOOT PROLOGUE, not at the instant the
        record lands, and that is a deliberately stronger guarantee: by the time
        this returns on the success path the boot registrations have come back
        from the session's loop and the heartbeat has been started. "The record
        exists" is not the same claim — a caller released at publication could
        hand the loop straight to a turn, starving the registration hop that
        ``_serve`` is still awaiting, and the runtime would publish a record and
        then never beat (measured: `wedged` at t=46 s with no client attached,
        i.e. the defect this change removes). ``_serve`` states the ordering
        where it is enforced.

        The obvious spelling — ``asyncio.to_thread(settled.wait, timeout)`` on a
        ``threading.Event`` — was measured at fleet depth and left a SECOND
        thread parked in the loop's default executor for the life of the
        process: 12 runtimes went from 1 thread each to 3, not 2, which is
        exactly the per-runtime cost §5.2 of the audit exists to watch. A
        ``PublicationGate`` binds the WAITER's loop and hops the open onto it
        with ``call_soon_threadsafe`` — the same class the deferred MCP wiring
        already uses for this exact cross-thread latch — so the wait is one
        parked coroutine and no thread at all. It is awaited here with
        ``asyncio.wait_for``, so a runtime that never publishes cannot park its
        caller for the life of the process either.

        A sibling of :meth:`announce_stop` rather than a reuse of it, and that
        distinction is the whole point: a viewer that reads ``stopping`` parks
        in the stopped state and tells the user ``/resume`` reopens it, which
        is the wrong story for a runtime that retired only because
        ``lop-update`` ran. ``retiring`` says "a fresh runtime is owed; engage
        one" and the viewer does so eagerly (``AttachedSession._go_cold(refresh=
        True)``). Additive on the wire: an old viewer ignores the unknown op,
        sees the EOF, and runs its ordinary recovery (cold after 8 s) — the
        pre-refresh behaviour, so no ``PROTOCOL_VERSION`` bump.

        ``draining`` is the runtime's OWN verdict, and it is the only place
        that verdict can come from: it is True when the departure was
        committed while work was still in flight (:func:`process._begin_drain`
        announces and latches in one step, so everything after this frame is
        refused until the drain empties), False for the idle handover
        (:func:`process._refresh_for` and :meth:`_retire_if_pristine`), which
        leaves in about a second and refuses nothing. A viewer that must say
        something to the operator reads THIS field: asking itself instead asks
        a state that is already cold by the time it can look, which is how a
        notice meant for the drain ended up painted on every idle handover as
        well (QA round 3, Q-1).

        Sent to ATTACH clients only. The phone daemon's projection path stays
        byte-identical, and the daemon already handles owner exit by adopting
        the next record it sees.

        ``leaving`` is that same commit's OTHER rendering, and this method is
        where both are written — which is the reconciliation PR #1108 required.
        #1108 landed the drain on the runtime's side and made this frame's
        ``draining`` flag the authoritative word for the APP; this branch had
        added ``SessionRecord.leaving`` for the FLEET surfaces. Two renderings,
        one fact, so one writer: the flag stays authoritative for "is a drain in
        force", the phrase carries the trigger's own words for the surfaces an
        operator reads, and a caller cannot publish one without the other
        because the record is written here, before the frame goes out, from the
        same call that sends it. ``process._commit_to_leaving`` is the only
        caller that passes both.

        AND THE FRAME CARRIES THE PHRASE TOO, which is the half the phrase
        existed for and did not yet have (design round 3, D6). ``draining`` says
        only THAT a drain is in force; it cannot say WHICH trigger committed it,
        and the app's notice is a SENTENCE about the trigger — it promised a
        newer build, so a runtime terminated mid-turn told the operator it was
        switching to a build that does not exist and is not coming. The phrase
        is the same string the fleet surfaces print (``SessionRecord.leaving``,
        written two lines up), so both renderings of the commit leave this one
        method and a viewer that must speak can quote the trigger instead of
        inferring it. Additive like ``draining`` was — a runtime older than the
        key sends no ``leaving``, and its frame is read off the fields it DOES
        carry (``reason``/``to``: ``stale-build`` for the released build
        handover, ``shutdown-drain`` — ``process._SIGNAL_DRAIN_REASON`` — for the
        signal drain this branch added before it added this key). That reader is
        :func:`types.leaving_phrase_for_frame`, and it exists because the
        simpler rule — "no phrase means the build handover" — was true of every
        RELEASED runtime and false of this branch's own intermediate builds,
        which signal-drained into it (design round 4, D9; agent review round 4,
        MAJOR-1).

        Awaited (unlike ``announce_stop``) because its one caller is the
        reaper on the runtime's own loop, which has time to drain: the exit
        follows this frame, and a viewer that receives it late merely goes
        cold the slow way. ON that loop, not from anywhere: the send path below
        owns the loop's ``send_lock`` and the connections' writers, and
        ``_send_to`` refuses a foreign-loop caller outright rather than parking
        it forever — so this method HOPS, and a caller may now sit on either
        plane.

        THE HOP IS NEW, and it is a repair rather than a convenience. Its
        callers (``process._commit_to_leaving``, ``process._refresh_for``) run
        on the SESSION's loop — the reaper and the signal drain both do — which
        was the owner loop only while ``daemon``/``exec`` served in process.
        Once the serving plane moved to its own thread (``start()``), the send
        below met ``_send_to``'s foreign-loop refusal, and the refusal was
        SWALLOWED: ``_commit_to_leaving`` catches it at DEBUG ("a viewer that
        misses this goes cold the slow way"). Viewers would simply stop
        learning that a runtime was retiring, and the drain would proceed — the
        quietest possible failure, which is why the hop lives here rather than
        in a caller's discipline. ``announce_stop`` already carries this
        contract; the two announces now behave the same from any thread.

        The ``SessionHandle`` protocol has always specified this shape — *"every
        method is awaited on the RUNTIME'S loop … the implementor guarantees any
        hop the session needs"* — and ``ServingSessionHandle`` now keeps that
        promise for its own asynchronous surface with ``@_on_session_loop``. A
        ``def`` cannot: there is nowhere in a synchronous method to await, and
        blocking on the other loop is exactly what this change forbids. So the
        few ``def``s whose work belongs to the session's loop are hopped HERE,
        by their caller, and this helper is the whole of that path:

        * ``subscribe`` / ``subscribe_events`` — the two boot registrations,
          whose bodies fold history and seed the projection's clocks and state;
        * ``is_pristine`` / ``may_refresh`` / ``begin_retire`` / ``request_stop``
          — the retire and kill-switch probes, where ``begin_retire`` in
          particular is a latch whose value is that it commits in the same
          synchronous step that checks, so it is hopped as ONE call rather than
          sampled and then committed;
        * ``has_admitted_command`` — the dedupe probe, which reads the
          transcript;
        * ``register_secret_redaction`` / ``cancel_subagents_count`` — the two
          ``_dispatch`` arms that write session state. Added in review: the
          first writes the redaction set the bash and eval redactors read, and
          the second runs ``Session.cancel_subagents``, whose task creation and
          loop-bound ``AsyncJobManager`` abort belong to the session's loop — on
          the runtime's thread the cancel's execution ran on the wrong loop and
          the manager swallowed its own cross-loop ``RuntimeError`` at WARNING
          while the op still acked success. The completion the ``await task``
          tracks is the manager's own, so what is lost is the caller's — the
          count the user reads is not evidence the cancel ran where the job
          lives.

        ``reannounce_pending`` is the one named method that does NOT come
        through here, deliberately: one of its four in-tree callers
        (``_drop_client``) is synchronous, so it cannot await a hop, and it is a
        read-then-NOTIFY whose notify path is the registrant's own
        thread-safe-by-design callback surface (the same shape the TUI kind has
        always used). See ``ServingSessionHandle.reannounce_pending``.

        Hop, never block: ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` plus ``await
        asyncio.wrap_future`` — never ``.result()``, which would freeze the
        runtime's loop for as long as the session's is busy and re-create the
        coupling this whole change removes. An awaitable RESULT is awaited on
        the session's loop too, so a caller may pass an ``async def`` handle
        method (the TUI's ``request_stop`` is one) and receive its value.

        A no-op in the two cases where there is nothing to hop: the caller is
        already on the session's loop (an in-process host, where the note above
        stays true), or the handle publishes no loop at all. That second case is
        what keeps this additive — a handle that owns its own hopping (the TUI's,
        which uses Textual's ``call_from_thread``) declares no ``session_loop``
        and keeps the behaviour it shipped with, and a reduced test host is

        That covers every registrant constructed for a viewer or a test, and it

        WHY IT EXISTS: the deferred wiring task's first instruction is a

        instant, which in ``process.amain`` is the inbox drain BEFORE this
        publisher runs, so on a machine with a server declared the import took
        the loop for its full duration inside the pre-publication window and the
        record waited behind it (measured +2.3 s, 14 of 14 runs). Setting the
        latch here moves the wiring to the far side of publication, which is

        WHY THIS IS A FENCE AND NOT A COURTESY. The ``stop`` op is answered by a
        host hook that tears its own runtime down: ``TuiSessionHandle.request_stop``
        schedules the app's teardown, the teardown closes the registrant, and
        :meth:`_shutdown_impl` drops every client — including the one waiting
        for the ack of the op that is doing the stopping. Losing that race turns
        a successful graceful stop into a client-side ``OwnerAckTimeout``, and
        the ladder then escalates to the signal rung on a session that had
        already ended politely. Measured on 2026-09-19 with a trace of
        ``_send_to``/``_shutdown_impl``/``_drop_client``: the shutdown ran at
        +1.035 s and dropped the connection with reason ``runtime shutdown``
        BEFORE the ack was written, and the client read
        ``ConnectionError('runtime closed the connection')``.

        THE RACE IS NOT NEW — the guarantee was. Until ``mobile/tui_handle``
        stopped blocking its own loop on the hop into Textual, the serving loop
        was held by that hop for the whole dispatch, so the teardown (which
        needs this loop to progress) could not overtake the ack. That was
        accidental, and removing it was the point of the change; this restores
        the guarantee deliberately, as the thing the runtime actually owes its
        client: **a request it has admitted is answered before the socket
        closes.**

        BOUNDED, because what this waits for may be another thread's event loop
        (a hop into Textual): a genuinely wedged app must not turn ``close``
        into a hang. After the grace the shutdown proceeds and drops the
        connection — the pre-existing behaviour — with a warning naming how many
        requests were still open.

        THE GRACE IS BOUNDED AGAINST THE CLIENT, NOT AGAINST THE CALLER, and
        that distinction is the whole reason the two numbers differ. Every
        client speaking to this socket gives a reply 15 s
        (``attach_client.ACK_TIMEOUT_S``), so five seconds is what gets an ack
        out while staying well inside its patience. A thread-hosted runtime's
        own caller waits less — ``aclose_remote`` awaits ``close``, whose join
        of the runtime thread is 2 s (``daemon=True``) — so THIS WAIT CAN
        OUTLIVE THE CALLER THAT ASKED FOR THE SHUTDOWN, and that is safe rather
        than an oversight: ``close`` already documents returning with the thread
        still finishing its own teardown, the thread owns this fence, and what
        the ack needs in order to land is the LOOP still running — not the
        caller still waiting. Matching the grace to the join instead would trade
        a live client's reply for the caller's tidiness. Measured in composition
        (``aclose_remote`` → ``close``, a real thread-hosted runtime with one
        admitted ``stop`` parked in its hook): a 1.5 s park — inside the grace —
        has the caller return at 1.51 s with the ack already written and nothing
        left in flight; a 6.0 s park — beyond both bounds — has the caller return
        at its 2.00 s join while the fence runs on to its grace, warns, and then
        proceeds to drop the connection. In that second case the parked op is
        left to unwind on its own, exactly as it was before this fence existed
        (``_dispatch_frame`` documents why op tasks are never cancelled), so the
        composition costs nothing that was not already spent.

        A per-connection task rather than inline work in ``_on_connection``; the
        reason it is deferred at all is at its creation site. It owns three
        invariants:

        * **The frame order is the frame order it always was.** Registration and
          snapshot capture still happen atomically inside the handle call, the
          sync frame is queued *before* ``frontend_ready`` opens, and every
          update that lands while this task is in flight waits in
          ``conn.frontend_pending`` — so a repaint cannot overtake the state it is
          a delta against. The task changes WHEN the bind runs, never the
          sequence of frames it produces.
        * **A failed bind does not leave a half-open connection.** Inline, a raise
          here escaped ``_on_connection`` — there is no caller to catch it, this is
          a ``client_connected_cb`` — so asyncio logged it as an unhandled
          exception in the callback while the connection stayed registered, never
          read and never dropped. As a task it has an owner: the failure drops the
          connection and releases its subscription.
        * **A busy owner does not hold the bind.** The on-loop bind is given
          ``_ONLOOP_BIND_GRACE_S``; past it this task binds OFF-LOOP through
          ``subscribe_frontend_nowait`` and queues the sync without a display
          window. What that buys is the whole point of the path — measured 15.0 s
          of control attach against a blocked owner, for a bind whose register
          half never needed that loop at all.

        ``subscribe_frontend`` arrives as a PARAMETER, resolved and
        capability-checked at the creation site: dropping a connection whose
        handle cannot bind belongs on the connection path, where the socket still
        exists to be closed, not inside a task. The off-loop capability is read
        here instead, and its ABSENCE is not a refusal: a single-plane handle (the
        TUI kind) simply keeps today's behaviour and waits the hop out.

            # FAILURE BUDGET, and the difference is what keeps the old reasoning

            # then killed at 10.01 s with ``owner exited`` while the app was
            # merely busy). Exceeding ``_ONLOOP_BIND_GRACE_S`` therefore changes

        Two callers, one contract. ``_drop_client`` cancels this connection's

        is STRUCTURAL rather than argued: the bind is shielded, so the cancel
        cannot abort it half-registered (``_serve_frontend_sync``), and this runs
        on the cancellation path to release whatever did register. The off-loop
        fallback reaches here having SUPERSEDED the same bind (``conn.bind_token``)
        — the shielded attempt still lands, and its subscription is just as
        unreachable. ``_drop_client``'s ordering follows from it — cancel first,
        then release the recorded subscription, so nothing is released twice.

        A DONE-CALLBACK rather than an await, and the difference matters twice
        over. ``_drop_client`` runs from the reader loop and from shutdown, so
        awaiting the bind there would park the teardown — and the loop with it —
        for as long as the abandoned hop takes, up to a whole hop budget, which is
        exactly the coupling this change exists to remove. And a callback cannot be
        skipped: a second cancellation racing the first would interrupt an await at
        the moment the release has to happen, while a callback registered on the
        task survives it.

        The task is held in ``self._abandoned_binds`` until it lands, because

        """Run one admitted request OFF this connection's reader loop.

        WHY THE READER NO LONGER AWAITS IT. The reader used to
        ``await self._on_request(...)``, which made a connection strictly serial
        — right for ORDERING (two mutations must not interleave) but wrong for
        LIVENESS: while one op is parked inside a hop into the session's loop,
        the reader cannot read the next frame, so everything else that client
        sent waits behind it. Measured over a real socket (review round 1, UX
        U3): a parked ``steer`` left ``ping`` on that same connection unanswered
        for 8-15 s — the one request a surface speaks to ask "are you there",
        queued behind a mutation. New connections were never affected (a fresh
        dial, its ping and its refusals all answered in 0.00 s), so "always
        connectable" held while "prioritize the health check" did not.

        ORDERING IS PRESERVED BY CHAINING, not by concurrency: each op waits for
        the one admitted before it, so a connection's frames still run one at a
        time and in arrival order. What changes is only that the READER stays
        free while it waits, and therefore keeps answering whatever else that
        client sends.

        The chain link is waited on with :func:`asyncio.wait`, which REPORTS a
        task's outcome rather than raising it: the earlier op's failure is its
        own business (``_on_request`` answers its own errors with an error
        frame), and an ordering link must never be an error channel that takes
        the next request down with it.

        ``ping`` is exempt from the chain (see :data:`_UNCHAINED_OPS`): a health
        check queued behind a mutation answers the wrong question, and measured
        (review round 1, UX U3) it did exactly that — 8-15 s of silence on a
        connection whose only sin was a parked ``steer``. An exempt op also does
        NOT become the chain head, and that is load-bearing rather than tidiness:
        the head is what the next mutation waits on, so letting a ping (which
        finishes at once) take it would let the mutation admitted after the ping
        overtake the one still in flight — reproduced before this line existed,
        where a parked ``steer`` was overtaken by the next ``steer`` because a
        ``ping`` had been admitted in between. The head therefore stays with the
        last CHAINED op, and the chain is transitive: waiting on the head is
        waiting on everything admitted before it.

        Cancellation is deliberately NOT propagated to these tasks. An op parked
        on a dead connection is left to unwind on its own, exactly as before
        this change (``_drop_client``'s ``phone_watchers`` note depends on that:
        an evicted daemon parked inside ``_on_request`` returns on its own), and
        ``conn.op_tasks`` holds the strong references meanwhile.

        ordinary 15 s heartbeat would leave up to a seventh of the drain
        invisible, which is most of the window it exists to describe.

        Deduped like :meth:`set_busy`, and it matters more here: the drain calls
        this once, but a repeat signal or a second drain arm on the same runtime
        must not put a staged write and rename on the far side of a signal.

        A NEW DEPARTURE SUPERSEDES THE LAST FAILURE, which is :meth:`note_updating`'s
        rule one rung over (its NIT 4) and is required here for the same reason plus
        one of its own. The reason is the window's: without it the record keeps
        describing an abandoned move after the runtime has started a NEW one, so a
        fleet row reads "update failed" about a session that is moving right now.

        The reason it has one of its own is that the record's OTHER half,
        ``update_failed``, describes THE HANDOVER THIS PHRASE ANNOUNCES — an abandon
        keeps the ordinary build phrase by design (``process._abandon_move``), so
        that field is the only thing separating a handover still waiting from one
        that was given up, and its readers are the fleet surfaces that print the two
        columns side by side (``info.collect``, ``cli``'s UPDATING cell, the incident
        row). A stale failure left beside a freshly latched drain makes that pair
        report the new attempt as the abandoned one. Cleared here rather than only on
        a change of phrase, because the second attempt at the same build announces
        the same words — the case that matters would otherwise be the one it got
        wrong.

        WHAT SURVIVES THE CLEAR, stated exactly: the failure is a DURABLE INCIDENT
        ROW (``note_update_failed`` writes ``UPDATE_FAILED_CAUSE`` with the pair and
        the bound it spent on the detail), which is the account an issue report
        cites, and the field is re-published if THIS attempt fails too. The handle's
        own memo is NOT part of that account — it is the WINDOW rung's
        (``serving.ServingSessionHandle.note_update_failed``, written by
        ``_abandon_update_window`` only, and it is what lets ``begin_update`` make the
        rung's ONE permitted retry: the pair is refused only once ``_update_retried``
        already holds it, so the memo stops a THIRD attempt rather than "re-opening a
        window that burned its bound") and the drain rung deliberately does
        not write it (agent review round 1, NIT-2; round 2, R2-NIT-1).

        person reading this session"; that one answers "could a banner reach
        them somewhere on this machine". Using the reachability predicate as a
        SUPPRESSION predicate is what made "this machine can banner" read as "a
        human is reading X": with the panel on X and the window behind another
        app, every OS surface went quiet while nobody was looking.

        A DESKTOP CONNECTION'S VISIBILITY IS NO LONGER THE RENDERER'S
        ``document.visibilityState``. That value says nothing sound about the
        window: a window behind another app is "visible", and a window Electron
        is throttling can report "hidden" while the user is reading it. So when
        a machine-wide delivery presence exists, ITS window state is the
        authority, and it can both grant and deny. When no presence exists — an
        older app, or none at all — the per-session flag below stands
        unchanged, which is what keeps this additive: an old UI's behaviour is
        byte-identical, and only a new one's occluded-window case changes (a
        banner IS raised, per the design's matrix).

        A TERMINAL ATTACH IS COUNTED ONLY WHILE IT IS DISPLAYING THIS SESSION,
        for the same reason the desktop leg consults window state rather than
        the socket. A multiplexing TUI retains the outgoing session's
        connection when the user switches away, so a live attach stopped
        meaning "on screen" and a gate parked behind one waited in silence for
        a card painted into a viewer showing something else. ``viewer_watch``

        question the MODEL needs, because a question asked now is answered when
        they look, not when they are looking.

        EXTENDED IN ROUND 3 (the transport-bound hole; see
        ``docs/design/attached-interface-signal.md``). The lease above is a fact
        about a SOCKET, and the socket is exactly what a bridge re-dial, a
        renderer stream restart or a runtime swap takes away — so the model was
        told "No interface is attached" while the app was open and the pane was
        mounted. Two bounded, independent terms answer that, either of which can
        grant:

        * the SESSION-SCOPED memory (``_desktop_attach_seen``) — the last
          accepted ``desktop_watch``, kept for the SAME 45 s window
          (``DESKTOP_WATCH_LEASE_S``; not a second constant and not wider) and
          not cleared by a drop. After the TTL with no heartbeat it is honest
          again, and an explicit ``desktop_withdraw`` clears it at once;
        * the app's own record, read narrowly — ``present ∧ has_window`` and a
          non-empty ``session_id`` equal to this session's, for a successor
          runtime booted under a still-open window before the re-dial lands
          (see ``_desktop_record_shows_this_session`` for why an empty name
          grants nothing).

        FOCUS IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and it must not be "tidied" into agreement
        with :meth:`_visible_attach_surfaces`. Focus flaps with window z-order,
        and this answer is rendered into the persisted system-prompt tail
        (``prompts_api.build_system_blocks``), so every flap would move a block
        the model carries on every request. A window that is merely not frontmost
        still holds a mounted pane this conversation can be painted into.

        THE DESKTOP CLAUSE IS THE LEASE AND NOTHING ELSE (round 1, MINOR 5). It
        used to read ``lease and (desktop_visible or desktop_can_notify)`` — the
        ``attach_clients()`` clause, on the theory that both asked "could this
        front end present something". That theory costs the model-facing answer
        its stability: ``desktop_visible`` is the app's ``visible &&
        focused``, so on a host with no OS-notification channel
        (``can_notify`` false — the JSON transport, browser dev) the clause
        collapses to ``visible``, and raising and lowering the window flips the
        persisted block and writes a ``[session-state]`` row. The lease is what
        the question actually asked for: it is renewed by a heartbeat that names
        THIS session's subscription and is withdrawn when the pane leaves
        (``desktop_withdraw``; a transient stream end is NOT a withdrawal — the
        memory above deliberately survives it), so "lease live" IS "a pane holds
        this conversation", with no window state and no notification capability
        in it. ``can_notify`` belongs to reachability (:meth:`notification_surfaces`)
        and ``visible`` to attention; neither is attachment.

        The reaper's own count (:meth:`attach_clients`) keeps the extra clause:
        it answers a RESIDENCY question, where an app that can neither show nor
        notify is not a reason to stay up, and the two are now deliberately not
        the same expression.

        A terminal attach is counted even while it is displaying ANOTHER session
        (``terminal_displaying`` False): the connection is the process that can
        paint the card the moment the operator switches back to it. This asks

        **A ``daemon`` connection is NOT somebody watching.** ``"daemon"`` is

        covers every session on the machine and is held open permanently

        running ``lop mobile`` no parked approval ever sent a notification,
        the gate held ~283 MB for 24 h, and the model was told a human was
        watching (round 3, B1). ``process.py::_viewer_attached`` reads this
        same table and counts only ``"attach"`` for exactly this reason.

        **A PHONE THAT IS BEING LOOKED AT REGISTERS THROUGH ``watch``.**
        ``phone_watchers`` is incremented by the ``watch`` control op, which
        the daemon pushes when a session's SSE subscriber count crosses 0↔N
        (`mobile/daemon.py::notify_watch_transition`) — i.e. exactly when a
        person opens or closes the session on their phone. That is the signal

        traded B1's false positive for a false negative: the fix introduced a
        parallel `note_viewer_active` mechanism that NOTHING called, so a user
        reading the session on their phone got a desktop toast for a card
        already on their screen, and the model was told nobody could answer
        (round 4, R1/Q1).

        ``watch_supported`` guards the mixed-version case for us: it latches
        on the first ``watch``/``unwatch`` ever seen, so a daemon too old to
        send the op leaves it False and this reports no phone rather than
        inventing one. That matches the reaper's reading of the same pair.

        capable console must not be indistinguishable by accident, and the
        distinction that matters is "proved" vs "did not".

        WHY NOT ``_authority_admitted`` ON A SYNTHETIC FRAME. That predicate
        reads the proof off the ``frame`` it is handed, and a frame constructed
        here has none — so it answered a constant ``False`` and told a console
        that had just loosened the gate that loosening "has to come from the
        window that started it" (agent review round 3, R3-1 = UX U10 = QA Q6:
        measured on production objects, on both the desktop and the phone).
        Passing the REQUEST frame instead is not a fix either: the request is
        ordinary, so an ordinary op would answer "may loosen" for a follower.

        What CAN be verified here is the HANDSHAKE proof: HMAC over THIS
        connection's nonce and salt, computable only by a process holding the
        capability. A client that spawned this runtime has both; a follower, an
        impostor holding the rewritten record, and a relay forwarding someone
        else's frames do not — the proof is bound to the connection's own nonce
        and salt, so another connection's proof does not verify here.

        AND THE OPERATOR SOURCE (revision 2). A LOCAL connection to a runtime with
        a usable anchor may loosen too — it asks for a challenge, signs it, and
        the signature costs one presence gesture. That is precisely the capability
        this revision restores, so reporting ``None`` here would tell an attached

        RETURNS ``kept: …`` rather than raising, and every one keeps the

        TWO ANSWERS ARE MORE PRECISE THAN THE QUESTION THEY REPLACE, because
        the caller reads this answer as a STATE rather than as a verdict:

        * A runtime that is ALREADY DRAINING its own exit says so instead of
          reporting the ``kept: busy`` its work in flight would otherwise
          produce. Those are different facts — "still working, moves when it
          ends" versus "leaving whatever you do next" — and only the second
          is true of a signalled runtime inside ``SIGNAL_DRAIN_S``.
        * ``kept: build on disk matches`` is NOT returned for an install that
          has moved but not settled. This is the answer ``lop refresh`` needs
          most precisely: its own documentation says its first run is
          ``lop-update``, so the operator calls it INSIDE the settle window,
          and calling that "already current" (with a zero exit status) tells a
          rotating script the fleet is done when every member of it is about
          to be retired (D1/M2, PR #1141). ``_build_changed`` deliberately
          folds "same stamp" and "not settled yet" into ``None`` — it answers
          "may I act" — so ``pending_build`` asks the settle question
          separately and the two cases answer differently.

        * the frame goes to the CONNECTION THAT ASKED, NEVER to the fan-out.
          An aside is a private question ("explain this model"); its text is not
          the session's event stream, so ``_clients`` is not consulted and a
          second viewer of the same conversation sees nothing of it HERE. That
          claim is scoped to this hop on purpose: the next one — a host
          forwarding to its renderers — is a fan-out of its own, and it is
          addressed for the same reason
          (``DesktopSessionBridge.publish_to_subscription``); a reader who takes
          this paragraph as a statement about the whole path would be reading it
          one hop too far.
        * the callback fires on the SESSION's loop, not this one:
          ``ServingSessionHandle.complete_aside`` is marshalled there whole, so
          the ``on_delta`` calls inside ``Session.complete_aside`` run on that
          thread. The one write below hops back with ``call_soon_threadsafe``,
          which from a single producer thread preserves emission order — a
          direct ``conn.event_queue.put_nowait`` from here would be a
          cross-thread mutation of an ``asyncio.Queue``.

        The frame is built fresh per chunk rather than mutated in place because
        ``_enqueue_client_frame`` runs the wire size fit over it, and a shared
        nested ``data`` dict is exactly the aliasing a future fit pass could

        """Fold the delta-grade and compose frame families in place.

        Merges runs of same-stream ``message_update``, ``reasoning_delta`` and
        ``aside_delta`` frames, and keeps only the NEWEST ``tool_call_compose``
        per ``tool_call_id``. Which frames belong to one stream is
        :func:`_mergeable_frame_key`'s rule (it delegates to
        :func:`_mergeable_delta_key` for the event families), and it is the only
        family-specific thing here apart from the head it rebuilds: the size
        accounting below is delta-sized and therefore family-agnostic.

        ``aside_delta`` IS A THIRD DELTA FAMILY AND THE SAME ARITHMETIC COVERS
        IT. One ``complete_aside`` streams a fragment per token, all but the last
        of which are pure progress — the aside's authoritative text is the POST
        receipt — so an unmergeable aside run is the reasoning family's failure
        mode again, on the surface whose slow reader is the phone: with
        ``_EVENT_QUEUE_MAX`` at 64 a stalled quick-ask takes
        ``event queue overflow`` instead of being compacted. The fold itself
        needs no special case for it: the same ``delta`` is concatenated, in
        arrival order, and only frames from the SAME request fold together (the
        request id is the stream — see :func:`_mergeable_frame_key`).

        All three are lossless by construction. For ``message_update`` the later
        event's ``message`` already contains the earlier one's text, and
        concatenating ``delta`` preserves the append contract UIs rely on. For
        ``reasoning_delta`` there is no accumulated payload at all — the frame
        carries one fragment, a ``message_id`` both frames agree on, and the
        same concatenation reproduces the two fragments in arrival order; this
        matters as much as it does for text, because reasoning arrives once per
        token, and a long-thinking turn is thousands of frames, so without the
        fold a stalled viewer's FIFO fills with incompressible reasoning frames
        and is dropped — the same failure the compose fold below was written
        for. ``aside_delta`` is that case again, one fragment per token of an
        answer the viewer is watching arrive. For
        ``tool_call_compose`` the argument is the one ``_fold_live_event``
        (``frontend_state.py``) already relies on for the reconnect seed: a
        compose frame is a SNAPSHOT of a call being dictated (``tool_name``,
        CUMULATIVE ``argument_bytes``, ``intent``), never a delta, so an older
        frame carries nothing the newer one lacks. Returns whether any room was
        freed. Runs synchronously on the runtime loop, so the drain task cannot
        observe a half-compacted queue.

        WHY THE COMPOSE FOLD EXISTS. Without it these frames are
        incompressible — each carries a distinct ``tool_call_id`` and a growing
        ``argument_bytes`` — so a viewer stalled during a tool-argument
        dictation fills its whole FIFO with frames compaction cannot touch,
        frees nothing, and is dropped with ``event queue overflow``. That is
        not hypothetical: at three concurrent calls the measured compose rate
        is 16.0 frames/s, which overflows ``_EVENT_QUEUE_MAX`` in ~4.0 s —
        BEFORE ``_TUI_SEND_TIMEOUT_S`` (5.0 s) can be reached, so the timeout
        raised from 1.0 s specifically to stop dropping stalled TUI viewers was
        bypassed for exactly the multi-call case it was meant to protect. The
        dropped viewer re-attaches, its seed re-mounts the composing rows, and
        nothing ever adopts or retires them: the user sees several tool cards
        frozen at one identical elapsed time on calls that in fact ran fine.
        Folding bounds the queue at ONE entry per in-flight call regardless of
        how long the dictation runs, which closes the class; raising
        ``_EVENT_QUEUE_MAX`` would only buy a linear factor against an
        unbounded dictation and re-open the memory question the bound exists
        for.

        THE COMPOSE FOLD REPLACES IN PLACE AND NEVER APPENDS. The newer frame
        takes the retained slot's FIFO position, and the fold is abandoned for
        a call as soon as any OTHER frame for that same ``tool_call_id`` goes
        by (``tool_execution_start``/``_update``/``_end``). Both halves are
        load-bearing: appending would let a compose frame arrive after the
        start that ends composition, and folding across an intervening start
        would move a compose frame BACK past it. Either way the viewer adopts
        out of order and can re-mount a composing row for a call that is
        already executing — the stranded row this fold exists to prevent.

        A COMPOSE KEY IS ONLY UNIQUE WITHIN ONE MODEL STEP, so two further
        guards keep a recycled key from folding across one. The id may be a
        placeholder (``compose:{index}``) derived from ``tool_states``, which
        ``harness/loop.py`` scopes to a single ``_model_turn`` — one STEP of a
        turn, not the whole run — so ``compose:0`` recurs on every tool-calling
        step. A step boundary (``turn_start``/``turn_end``) clears every slot,
        and independently a fold is refused when ``argument_bytes`` goes
        BACKWARDS, which cannot happen within a call and so proves the key was
        reused. Only clearing on ``agent_start``/``agent_end`` guarded the run
        boundary while leaving the step boundary — the common one — open
        (review R1).

        A MERGE THAT WOULD NOT FIT IS REFUSED, and that check cannot be
        skipped on the grounds that everything in this queue already passed
        ``relay_frame_or_degraded``. It did — individually. Merging is the one
        operation here that makes a frame BIGGER than anything the guard was
        shown, so it can assemble individually-legal frames into an
        unreadable one downstream of the only guard: 20 frames of 908,157 B
        merged to 1,060,157 B and killed a real pump, and at 1 KiB deltas a
        full 64-frame queue merged to 1,109,802 B — within 20 KB of the frame
        that killed the operator's socket. The trigger is precisely the burst
        this method exists to absorb.

        REFUSED, not degraded, because refusing is lossless: both frames are
        individually sendable, so keeping them apart costs one queue slot and
        no content, while degrading would throw away deltas the viewer needs.
        Refusing can leave nothing compacted, and that is the honest answer —
        the caller then drops a client it genuinely cannot serve, which is the
        documented slow-reader path rather than a silently broken socket.

        past ``_MAX_LINE_BYTES`` is not merely large: the peer dials with the
        SAME limit, its ``readline`` raises, and its pump dies — the viewer
        then paints "owner sent a frame too large to read" and the session
        cannot be opened at all. ``cap_projection_frame`` is a SOFT cap that
