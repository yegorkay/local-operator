"""Sessions the daemon owns: started from the phone, run in-process.

An owned session is a full harness ``Session`` built with the same
composition root as the CLI (:func:`session_factory.create_session`), wrapped
in the :class:`~local_operator.session.runtime.server.SessionHandle`
contract and registered through the SAME loopback socket path a TUI uses.
That last part is the design's keystone: the daemon's web layer never
branches on who owns a session, so a phone-started session and a terminal
session are indistinguishable to the UI — and connection failure handling
(re-dial, degraded, ended) has exactly one implementation.

Approval and ask gates are installed at spawn: the harness calls them when a
tool needs the user, and this bridge parks the call on a future whose
resolution arrives as a control request from the phone. The pending request
is on the projection the whole time, so a phone that opens mid-approval sees
the card — a question for the user is the most prominent thing on screen
(branding.md §7), and "the agent is waiting" must survive a phone restart.

    A fresh boot CAN produce the pair too, and the reference is a pathological

    ``json.loads`` raises ``RecursionError`` on a deeply nested document, and
    ``mcp/config.py::_read_json`` catches only ``OSError``/``ValueError``/

    this keys on the roster rather than on how the emptiness arose.

    findable (``lop sessions``, the phone, the supervising session's own
    transcript), so silence here costs no information.

    Read from the DURABLE MARKER rather than from the environment, and that is
    the whole design. An earlier candidate was the kill switch
    ``agent_shell.harness_child_env`` already carries, and it cannot work: no
    production path calls that helper (only benches, probes and the eval

    to fix, one rung up.

    A session with no transcript directory at all cannot be described by the

    in ``resume``'s own contract, and a runtime whose session has no directory
    yet is not a hidden agent run. The same answer covers a handle whose session

    """Run a handle method's WHOLE BODY on the loop that owns the session.

    WHY A WRAPPER AND NOT A SYNCHRONOUS CALL. The failure this replaces was not a
    slowdown, it was a turn run on the wrong thread. Measured on a naive
    thread-hosted runtime (``probe_daemon_threaded.py``, before this seam): a
    ``prompt`` reached the handle from the runtime's thread, created its
    ``admitted`` future with ``self._loop.create_future()`` — the SESSION's loop
    — and then scheduled the drain task with ``asyncio.ensure_future``, which
    binds to the CALLER's. So the client got an asyncio cross-loop error while
    the turn ran on ``lop-mobile-registrant``, and the session was left
    un-disposable. Every ``self._loop``-bound object the body creates has to be
    created where it belongs, and the only way to guarantee that for the whole
    body — including the sync prefix before the first await — is to run the body
    there.

    WHAT IT GUARANTEES. Nothing of the body executes on the caller's thread: the
    coroutine is handed to the owner loop with
    ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` and awaited back through
    ``asyncio.wrap_future``, never ``.result()``. The result is unchanged, and
    every synchronous read the body makes — session state, the transcript, the
    reservation map — is made where that state lives.

    CALLING IT FROM THE SESSION'S LOOP IS A NO-OP, deliberately: a hop from the
    loop you are hopping TO would be a round trip to the thread already
    executing, which is the shape this class's original docstring was right
    about for an in-process host. That also covers a nested call — a decorated
    method calling another one — and every in-process runtime, so no caller has
    to know which plane it is on.

    WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CALLER IS CANCELLED is measured, not assumed, because
    a sibling change depends on it: the cancellation DOES reach the remote body.
    ``asyncio.wrap_future`` propagates it to the concurrent future
    ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` returned, and that future cancels the task it
    scheduled — verified directly, a remote ``await asyncio.sleep(5)`` raising
    ``CancelledError`` 0.3 s after the awaiting task was cancelled. So a
    ``prompt`` whose caller is dropped does not leave a turn running detached
    from the client that asked for it, which is what
    ``RuntimeServer._drop_client``'s teardown reasoning relies on.

    And it hops only when there is a loop to hop to: a handle whose loop is gone
    runs the body inline so that teardown paths (``dispose``) still work, and
    ``_check_loop_thread`` refuses the mutating ones that would then be executed
    off-loop rather than silently running them on the wrong thread.

    THE SEAM LIVES IN :func:`_on_session_loop`, which decorates every mutating
    method below, and the premise it repairs is worth keeping visible because it
    is how this handle came to be the one implementation that did not marshal:
    *"the child process runs the registrant's socket server as a task on its one
    asyncio loop, so no cross-thread hop is needed and ``run_coroutine_threadsafe``
    never appears."* That was true while ``daemon`` and ``exec`` served in
    process.

    It is not true now. ``process.amain`` and ``exec_control.start_exec_control``
    both reach the runtime through ``RuntimeServer.start()``, which puts the
    registrant on its OWN thread, so every handle call from the registrant crosses
    threads. The contract this class now implements is the one the
    ``SessionHandle`` protocol always stated — *"every method is awaited on the
    RUNTIME'S loop … the implementor guarantees any hop the session needs"* — and
    the invariant it holds, stated once so no method has to restate it:

        No coroutine on the runtime's loop performs a synchronous cross-thread
        wait, and no code on the session's loop is called from the runtime's
        thread except through a hop whose result is awaited.

        THE EXEMPTIONS ARE NAMED, NOT COUNTED — a number here is what drifted
        twice already, in this class, for exactly this reason (review round 2,
        NIT-1; the "six" this branch removed). They are one MUTATION and a
        CATEGORY of reads, which is why "one exception" was never the right
        shape:

        * the mutation: ``redate_from_phase`` writes the fold's phase clock from
          ``RuntimeServer._projection_payload``. Deliberate and bounded — it sits
          on the WELCOME path, so hopping it would re-couple the welcome to the
          turn, which is the coupling this change exists to remove and the reason
          a fresh dial is served while the loop is busy.
        * the reads: ``session_projection_seed`` hands out the LIVE projection
          object, and ``is_busy``/``is_conversationally_active``/``subagent_counts``
          are plain field reads — the class the heartbeat has always made from
          this side, and they are named in the status bullet below rather than
          hopped. A read of a field the session's loop owns is not the hazard the
          hop exists for; a write is, and there is one.

        The pair is exactly what the TUI kind already does (audit §2.2: a data
        race in principle, shipped since the pair was written), the values are an
        int and an object reference, and the alternative was measured worse.

    Which is enforced where:

    * every ``async def`` that touches session state carries
      ``@_on_session_loop``, so its WHOLE BODY runs on the session's loop and the
      caller awaits the result — futures, tasks and the prompt queue included;
    * the ``def``s that mutate or read session state cannot hop themselves (a
      synchronous method has nowhere to await), so the REGISTRANT hops them
      through ``server.RuntimeServer._handle_call_on_session_loop``: that is
      ``subscribe``/``subscribe_events`` (boot registrations),
      ``is_pristine``/``may_refresh``/``begin_retire``/``request_stop`` (the
      retire and kill-switch probes), ``has_admitted_command`` (the dedupe
      probe) and ``register_secret_redaction``/``cancel_subagents_count`` (the
      two ``_dispatch`` arms that mutate session state) — the last two added in
      review, because a cancel that runs on the runtime's thread executes on the
      wrong loop and has its cross-loop ``RuntimeError`` swallowed while the op
      still reports success;
    * ``reannounce_pending`` is the one named method that is deliberately NOT
      hopped: one of its in-tree callers (the registrant's ``_drop_client``) is
      synchronous and cannot await a hop, and it is a read-then-NOTIFY whose
      notify path is the registrant's own thread-safe-by-design callback
      surface — the same shape the TUI kind has always used, and the reason its
      own docstring says the registrant calls it;
    * plain reads of session state (``is_busy``, ``is_conversationally_active``,
      ``subagent_counts``, ``session_projection_seed``) are read directly, which
      is what the TUI handle documents as safe and what the heartbeat has always
      done;
    * ``_check_loop_thread`` is the enforcement on the other side of the seam:
      it raises if a body reaches it from a thread that does not own the session,
      which can now only mean the hop was impossible (no loop, or a closed one).

    ``spawn_owned_session`` is the only constructor, and it binds ``loop`` to the
    loop the session lives on.

        A ``config.yml`` write is the operator's machine-wide intent ("if I
        change a setting I want it to go into effect for all my agents"), so a
        session that never made a choice of its own follows the file in BOTH
        directions — with ONE exception, the loosening rule below, which is what
        makes the SOURCE of a policy change part of the authorization decision
        and not merely its value.

        **The rule is asymmetric, and its loosening half has two refusal
        reasons** (review round 1 R1, UX round 1 U1; issue #1282):

        * **Tightening (``auto`` → ``ask``) always follows the file**,
          unconditionally, in every session. Safety propagates without
          exception; a user ends up safer than they asked, which is never the
          wrong surprise.
        * **Loosening (``ask`` → ``auto``) is refused unless it is attributed**
          (#1282). Only a write THIS process made through the operator's own
          settings facade (``source="local"``) is an operator action; a model
          tool's own file write, an editor, another pane, the settings API in
          another process, and ``lop config edit`` are all unattributable from
          here, and unattributed writes may only tighten. See
          :func:`local_operator.harness.approval.loosening_is_authorised` for
          the rule itself and why it is `source == "local"` rather than "not
          disk".
        * **Loosening does not move a session whose human typed ``/approvals
          ask`` in it** either, and that branch is checked FIRST so the more
          specific reason is the one printed. It is the CHOSEN MODE that is
          consulted, not merely the fact of a choice: a session whose human
          chose ``auto`` has no hardening to protect, but this process still
          refused the unattributed write that would have moved it.

        The asymmetry is the whole point. The operator asked for settings to
        REACH running sessions, which was broken and is what this change fixes;
        they did not ask for a file write to revoke a hardening a human typed
        into a specific pane thirty seconds earlier, and they did not ask for a
        model-run shell command to remove the gate from its own later calls.
        The parked-prompt rule below already encodes the same principle — a card
        on screen is not auto-answered *because the human's presence outranks
        the file* — and it applies one step earlier to a human who typed the
        mode. This mirrors the model half of the same change exactly (``Session.
        _on_configured_model_changed``, ``_explicit_model_choice``, and its
        ``keeping …`` notice), and approvals is the more dangerous of the two
        keys: an explicit ``/model`` pick was already protected while an
        explicit ``/approvals ask`` was not, which reversed the safer default
        on the key where it matters more.

        Two further limits, unchanged. ``--yolo`` (``_approval_pinned``)
        outranks the key entirely — an explicit flag on this run is narrower
        and newer than a default in a file — and a prompt already PARKED
        (``_pending_futures``) is left alone: the gate reads ``_auto_approve``
        when a decision is made, so a card on screen keeps waiting for the
        human, never auto-answered on a loosening and never auto-denied on a
        tightening.

        The receipt goes out as a :class:`NoticeEvent` from THIS process, the
        one that owns the gate, so every attached viewer and the phone see
        the effect ("every tool runs without asking"). It is now the ONLY
        receipt for the event: the TUI no longer prints a value clause when a
        runtime is attached (design round 1, D1), on the same "the process that
        decided is the one the user should read" rule the ``model`` section
        already follows. Subagents inherit this gate closure, so they follow

        Deliberately narrower than :meth:`is_busy`, and the difference is the
        whole point. The two answer different questions:

        * :meth:`is_busy` asks *may this runtime exit?* and must be maximally
          inclusive, because exiting under live work destroys it. A detached
          background job, a running subagent, a retained background task all
          forbid an exit and are all counted there.
        * This asks *is this conversation working right now?*, which is what an
          animated indicator claims to a user. Somebody reading a spinner
          expects tokens to be moving and a reply to be coming.

        Publishing the residency answer as the activity bit made every session
        that had ever backgrounded a job look permanently busy. Measured on the
        reporter's host: 8 of 8 live sessions published ``busy=True``, one of
        them idle for 25.6 minutes with a completed final turn — the runtime
        was correctly resident (a `bash` job was still running) and the sidebar
        was incorrectly claiming it was working. A spinner that is always on is
        not a status; the user's report ("still shows that it's active … even
        though the task is done") is exactly that indicator having become
        meaningless.

        The terms kept here are the ones a user would call "it is working on my
        conversation": a live provider stream, a compaction, a held turn lock,
        a queued or draining prompt, a running goal loop, and a parked gate.
        The gate is included because a parked approval IS a running turn — the
        tool slot is held mid-flight — and the surfaces then draw it with the
        needs-you marker, which outranks the spinner in ``row_state_mark``.

        The terms dropped are the work-RETENTION ones: background jobs,
        subagents, MCP grant/reload tasks and retained background tasks. Each
        is real work the runtime must stay alive for, and none of it means the
        conversation is mid-reply — a `background=true` job exists precisely to
        outlive its turn, so animating a row for it contradicts the flag's
        purpose. Those sessions still render as live (the idle glyph), and
        `lop sessions` still reports them resident.

        Fails CLOSED (True) on an unreadable probe, matching :meth:`is_busy`:
        a spurious spinner is a cosmetic fault, while a missed one would hide a
        session that genuinely is working.

        not cut, because the idle gate above means no turn is in flight when
        this succeeds (agent review round 1, MAJOR-1).

        Refuses while this handle is already disposing, mirroring
        :meth:`begin_drain`: the disposal owns the ordering from ``_disposing``
        on, and a second rung committing to an exit would race it into

        THE HARD-STALE RUNG, and the session-runtime expression of the shape
        ``server/retire.py`` gives the ``serve`` daemon — notice the install
        move, announce the handover, refuse new work, leave when nothing is in
        flight. Three things differ, and each is what a VIEWER makes different:

        * the daemon announces into its RECORD and keeps serving while anything
          is attached, latching only once its drain has emptied; this
          announcement is a frame to a client that is waiting on this very
          connection and is followed by the latch in the same step, because a
          runtime that waited for its viewer would be the defect rather than the
          fix (see ``process._begin_drain`` for the ordering argument);
        * the drain is BOUNDED by the caller (``process._BuildWatch``), because
          a session runtime can be busy for hours and the process that runs its
          next engage is waiting on this one leaving;
        * a message that arrives mid-drain is SPOOLED for the successor rather
          than refused, because a session has a successor to defer to.

        :meth:`begin_retire` refuses while any work would be lost, which is
        right for a refresh that can wait — the runtime will retire on its own
        at the next instant nothing is running — and wrong for a runtime whose
        loaded build has been replaced on disk: a session busy for hours never
        reaches such an instant, so "ask again next check" is a promise the
        build breaks. This latch drops the idle gate and keeps everything else:

        * admissions refuse from HERE — invariant (i), no new work after the
          commit. ``prompt`` refuses; ``receive_peer_message`` SPOOLS, because
          a wake or a steer is a message somebody is waiting on rather than a
          turn this runtime is being asked to run now;
        * nothing in flight is touched — invariant (ii). The live turn, its
          subagents, its jobs and a parked gate run to completion, and the
          process leaves at the first instant the reaper finds the work done;
        * wakes that fire from now on are spooled for the successor rather than
          run against a build that is leaving — invariant (iv), see
          ``Session.retire_wakes_to_inbox``;
        * and a settled child's result is HELD durably for whoever turns next -
          charged to the same invariant (i), which the refusals above only
          appear to hold: a job delivery is harness-initiated and reached
          ``Session._deliver_job_results`` directly, so it opened a turn this
          runtime could only abort. See
          ``Session.retire_job_deliveries_to_transcript`` for the measured
          incident and the two spellings it was fixed as.

        Deliberately NOT ``note_cut_off``: no turn is being cut off. The turn
        running when this latches is expected to FINISH, and arming a cut-off
        for it would relabel a completed turn as an error — the note belongs to
        the DISPOSAL, and only for a turn the disposal is actually aborting
        (:meth:`_note_retirement_cut_off`).

        ``cause`` is the vocabulary token the refusal and the eventual cut-off
        note carry; ``detail`` is free text for the log. Returns whether the
        drain is latched — False only when this handle is already disposing, in

        the exit rung, so the departures stay distinguishable all the way to the
        last refusal.

        AND A DEPARTURE THIS SIDE CANNOT NAME IS SENT AS NO TOKEN RATHER THAN AS
        A BUILD. It was sent as a build by omission until round 5: the token was
        "SIGNAL or nothing", and "nothing" meant the build sentence on the far
        side, which is false for a signalled runtime from this branch's pre-key
        builds — they announce the signal drain with no phrase key either — and
        for the reaper's ``idle-exit`` latch, which owes no successor and checked
        no build (agent review round 5, MINOR-1; UX round 5, U14; design round 5,
        D11). Those runtimes cannot be taught to send a token, so the far side
        answers an unnamed departure from the phrase the frame published and with
        the sentence that names no departure when there is none. The field stays
        additive and closed either way: ``server`` emits ``error_trigger`` only
        when the token is truthy, and an older client drops the key.

        WHY THE BUILD CAUSE IS NOT NAMED HERE, though this side does know it. The
        ``runtime-retired`` latch is shared by the stale-build refresh and by
        ``/move`` (``server._retire_for``: ``"stale-build"`` with a successor, or
        ``"moved"`` with none), and the cause token is the same for both — the
        cause is what a restored session renders, so it cannot be split without
        changing that vocabulary. Naming it ``BUILD`` would therefore claim "the
        one it loaded is gone from disk" for a session that merely changed
        directory. The phrase is the carrier that CAN tell them apart for a
        drain, and for a build drain the frame publishes it; a move publishes
        none, and correctly gets the sentence that names no departure.

        The draining alternative to refusing. ``inbox.jsonl`` is drained by the
        successor at boot (``process._drain_inbox_into``) BEFORE its control
        socket listens, so a row written here lands ahead of anything a socket
        client could send — the ordering guarantee is the whole reason this
        vehicle works for a message that arrived at a dying process. It is
        also the one channel that survives the handover: a peer wake or a
        steer is someone asking THIS session to do something, and turning that
        into a refusal they must re-issue is a worse answer than a deferral
        they were told about.

        ``wake`` rides the ROW, because it is the sender's ask rather than the
        reader's choice: ``send --wake`` asked for a turn, and a successor that
        filed the text as a quiet note would keep the message and never do the
        work (review round 1, MINOR 3 — the field used to be written and then
        ignored, so every spooled wake could only be read). The receipt names
        which of the two shapes the sender bought, because that is the part
        they can act on: re-issuing a spooled wake is not necessary.

        ``mode`` is recorded and deliberately NOT honoured on delivery, which
        is the one thing a reader of this row has to know: both drain paths
        deliver ``mailbox`` (plus ``wake`` when the sender asked for one),
        because a boot has no live turn for a ``steer`` to join — mailbox-plus-
        wake is the only shape that can land at all. Keeping the sender's
        stated intent in the row is for whoever reads the spool later, not an
        instruction to the successor (review round 2, NIT 1).

        Falls back to the refusal when there is nowhere to spool to (no session
        directory, an unwritable inbox): the caller then gets the sentence that
        tells it to send again, which is the same contract every other admission
        gets once a runtime is leaving.

        ``source`` and ``command_id`` are the OWNER's-prompt halves and default
        to the peer shape, so the peer callers above are unchanged and a row a
        build older than these fields wrote still reads as a peer row. See
        ``inbox.SOURCE_USER`` for why the successor cannot guess: the two
        deliveries differ in provenance, not just in wording. The receipt
        follows the source, because the two senders are buying different things
        from the same vehicle — a peer's message is held for the next runtime, a
        user's own prompt is queued onto it, and only the second one is the same
        admission their composer was refused a moment ago.

        An attached viewer does NOT hold. That is the operator's rule and the

        its whole body onto the loop that owns the session
        (``@_on_session_loop``), which is required for the refresh it publishes
        — but it makes the caller wait out whatever synchronous step the turn is

        The SUBSCRIBE half needs no loop at all. ``subscribe_threadsafe`` admits
        the callback and captures the snapshot in one critical section of the
        store's publish lock, so this returns immediately and the loop is left

        is held, and this queue is not the only thing that takes that lock: a
        background job's result delivery, a peer wake, a scheduled wake, a resume
        catch-up (all ``Session._prompt_messages``) and an on-demand compaction
        do too. A prompt this queue had already ACCEPTED was therefore failed
        after admission whenever one of those won the race to the lock — a
        desktop send answered 503, and before the reservation fix its same-id
        retry was reported admitted without ever landing (QA on PR #1528,
        Q1-5, and the "prompt failed after admission … TurnInFlight" log line).
        The accepted prompt has to wait its turn exactly as it waits behind a
        prompt queued ahead of it here.

        ACQUIRED AND RELEASED, not polled: the lock's own FIFO is the event, so
        this wakes the moment the holder (and anything queued before this wait)
        lets go. Holding it for no work is harmless. What makes the hand-off
        sound is that the caller's ``Session.prompt`` probe then runs with NO
        await in between — a coroutine's body runs synchronously up to its first
        suspension — so the probe sees the lock free; a wake that queued behind
        this wait is then ahead of the prompt's own ``acquire``, which waits
        rather than refusing.

        WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROMISE: this is not "an admitted prompt cannot fail".
        ``Session.prompt`` re-checks ``_is_streaming`` once it holds the lock,
        and its ``@path`` expansion awaits outside it — an approval card parked
        on a person is enough for a turn to start and finish in that gap — so the
        refusal is still reachable. What covers it is the release of the id on
        failure, which is what makes the retry admit; the probe's own verdict is
        attributed per turn for the same reason (see ``observe_end``).

        THE FAIRNESS RELIED ON: CPython's ``Lock.acquire`` wakes waiters FIFO
        and its uncontended fast path is guarded by
        ``all(w.cancelled() for w in self._waiters)``, so a waiter this wait has
        woken is not jumped by the next caller. A future interpreter that took
        the fast path with a woken waiter would let the prompt overtake it — a
        fairness loss, never a refusal, because the probe would still find the
        lock free.

        A session without the lock (a reduced double, a third-party protocol
        host) keeps the historical behaviour of refusing at the probe.
        Cancellation (``dispose``) propagates, and ``asyncio.Lock`` hands the

        """Stop this session's turn AND its children, and say what was stopped.

        THE CONTROL OP HAS NO SECOND RUNG. The keyboard's Esc ladder can afford
        a narrow first press because a second press within
        ``DOUBLE_STOP_WINDOW_S`` is right there, offered on screen, and stops
        the children. Nothing on this path has that: the mobile relay, a
        supervisor and ``lop`` peers all send ``abort`` once into a session
        they cannot see, and there is no gesture that escalates. Reusing the
        keyboard's narrow semantics here therefore gave callers a stop that
        could NEVER reach a runaway — the operator sent ``abort``, was acked
        ``stopping``, and watched 39 paid provider calls land in the next two
        seconds while their children kept reporting in (QA Q-1). Escalating is
        what makes "a user must always be able to halt a runaway" true on the
        surface that has no ladder to climb.

        THE RECEIPT MUST NOT OVERSTATE, AND IT IS COUNTED AFTER THE FACT.
        It previously returned the literal ``"stopping"`` whatever survived,
        which is how the operator was told the problem was handled while the
        meter ran. Reporting ``cancel_subagents()``'s return value instead
        would only move the lie: that number is ``len(running)`` sampled at
        DISPATCH time, before any child has actually gone, and per-child
        cancellation is fire-and-forget with failures swallowed by design. A
        child that refuses to die was therefore counted as stopped — measured
        with two of three cancels raising, the receipt still said "stopped 3
        subagents" while two kept running and spending (review round 1,
        MAJOR-1).

        So the count is taken from the session's own live predicate once the
        cancellations have had a chance to land, and anything still standing is
        named as still running. Backgrounded ``bash`` jobs deliberately outlive
        a stop (``background=true`` exists so a build survives the turn that
        started it), so they are named too rather than implied stopped.

        AND THE CARD ON SCREEN IS DENIED HERE, not left to the cancellation
        below. A gate parked in a LIVE turn is already cleared by it —
        ``_session.abort`` fires the turn's AbortSignal, the batch's abort
        watcher unwinds the parked await through the gate closure's ``finally``
        — which is why this went unnoticed. What cancellation cannot reach is
        the ORPHAN: a card that outlived its turn (the drain gave up on a tool
        whose cleanup outran ``ABORT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_S``, or no turn was live at
        all) is parked on a future nothing will ever resolve, so the user's own
        stop left the question on screen while the receipt said a turn had been
        stopped. Denying FIRST and cutting second is the order that closes the
        window between the two: with the gate already settled, no answer can

        "the event is still owed and nothing is coming" — only the last two are
        worth retrying (R7).

        THE LAST RUNG, AND A GATE RATHER THAN A RACE. This runs at turn settle,
        which is EARLIER than every other surface learns about the completion —
        the desktop feed polls at 100 ms and the TUI at 1 s. Announcing
        unconditionally would therefore win the claim for the runtime every
        time and make both richer paths dead: the desktop's composed banner and
        a running TUI's. So ELIGIBILITY IS DECIDED BEFORE THE CLAIM, which is
        also the ordering the TUI's own announcer uses when it checks
        ``live_state`` before claiming.

        The rungs, first match wins, exactly as the design's ladder states them:

        1. **A surface is WATCHING this session** — a TUI attached to it, a
           phone, or a desktop window actually displaying it. The card is in
           band there; an OS banner on top would be pure interruption. Note the
           predicate is the VISIBILITY one, never ``notification_surfaces()``:
           "a banner could reach somebody somewhere" is not "a person is
           reading this", and using reachability here suppressed the banner for
           a session nobody was looking at.
        2. **A desktop app on this machine can attempt a COMPLETION banner**
           (:mod:`local_operator.session.runtime.presence`) — the machine-wide
           feed composes it, so the runtime stays silent. Narrowed by KIND: the
           feed carries completions only, so this arm is the only place that
           asks, and a parked ``ask``/``approval`` keeps its per-session lease
           and its per-session toast untouched.
        3. **A TUI is running anywhere on this machine** — its 1 s background
           announcer raises it, and two announcers would be one too many.
        4. **Nothing** — this arm.

        A claim that then fails to deliver is handed straight back, because a
        watermark asserting a banner nobody received is the silent hole
        ``release_delivery`` exists to close. That release is also guaranteed
        when the RAISE ITSELF raises (R7): the previous arrangement let an
        exception escape past the release branch, which left exactly that
        watermark behind for a banner that was never raised — the worst of both
        outcomes, since the completion was neither announced nor left claimable.

        A SILENCED PROCESS DOES NOT CLIMB THE LADDER AT ALL, and it returns
        SETTLED rather than DEFERRED. Checking this first is what stops a
        mock-hosting runtime from taking a delivery claim and releasing it
        every turn — a write and an un-write in the operator's attention store
        per turn, for a banner that would never be raised (the claim is a
        watermark asserting "somebody was told"; nobody was). SETTLED is the
        honest outcome: nothing is owed TO THIS PROCESS. Nothing is lost
        either, because the durable unseen mark is untouched, so any surface
        that still delivers — a TUI, a desktop app — reads the same state and
        raises its own banner.

        A HIDDEN SESSION DOES NOT CLIMB IT EITHER, for the same reason and with
        the same outcome (:func:`_session_may_announce`). A delegated run's
        completion belongs to the session that owns it and is already visible
        there; a toast for it is the operator being told about work he neither
        opened nor can see in any list. Settled rather than deferred, and the
        same absence of contention as the silenced arm above: no claim, no
        release, and the durable mark left exactly as another surface needs it.

        The aside seam: a viewer asks a question that must NOT enter the
        durable conversation (the model picker's "explain this model", the
        mobile quick-ask). It runs on the authoritative session because it
        needs the real model, credentials and context — which is why it
        cannot be answered viewer-side.

        THIS IS THE REMOTE SEAM'S INSTRUCTION SITE, and that is a placement,
        not an implementation detail: :func:`wrap_aside_turns` wraps the last
        user turn here because every remote caller reaches the primitive
        through a handle like this one. It used to be applied by the TUI alone,
        so the desktop ``/asides`` route sent the model the user's raw question
        with no instruction that it was off the record and no instruction not
        to call a tool — which is why tool calls appeared on that surface.
        :meth:`Session.complete_aside` deliberately stays bare: its in-process
        callers supply their own instruction, and the goal-loop judge (which
        calls it with ``LOOP_JUDGE_PROMPT``) must never receive an aside wrap.
        The stored/returned aside turns stay RAW — only the provider request
        carries the wrapper, so the user never sees ``<aside>`` XML.

        ``aside_instruction`` IS THE CALLER'S DECLARATION, not the seam's
        assumption, and it defaults to True for the reporters this seam exists
        for: a caller that sends RAW turns (the desktop ``/asides`` route, the
        phone's quick-ask) gets the instruction applied here whether or not it
        knows this parameter exists. A caller that supplies its OWN instruction
        — the TUI's ``/btw`` overlay, and the goal-loop judge, whose question is
        ``LOOP_JUDGE_PROMPT`` and not an aside at all — passes ``False``.
        WITHOUT THE FLAG the TUI's pre-wrapped question was wrapped a second
        time on a session it was only VIEWING (its ``self._session`` is an
        ``AttachedSession`` there, so this handle runs in the owner), the judge
        was framed as an aside question, and both failures were silent.
        :func:`wrap_aside_turns` is idempotent underneath, so a caller that gets
        the flag wrong is not doubled — the two cannot disagree without the
        turn list showing it.

        ``on_delta`` forwards each streamed text chunk to the caller that asked
        for it, as it arrives. OPTIONAL, and probed by signature against the
        primitive: an older/reduced session without the parameter is answered in
        one settled piece exactly as before. The ``on_usage`` accrual below is
        NOT optional and must keep riding every call — it is what stops a hidden
        way of spending tokens for free (a remote aside, the goal judge) from
        costing zero.

        Found by the post-U9 migration audit rather than by a review: without
        it every aside answered "this owner cannot run off-record requests".

        is replaced under long-lived TUIs several times a day, and the runtime
        a stale TUI spawns is built from the NEW install.

        The rule is ``type not in declared``, never "declared is None": a
        client that declared the type submits the request itself and the

        running and cannot be updated in place.

        KNOWN DEGRADATION: the viewer expands collapsed pastes into the
        request text at submit time, and those payloads live in the VIEWER's
        composer — they cannot cross the wire retroactively. A request
        admitted here that cites ``<[Paste #1, 240 lines]>`` reaches the

        a worse failure than the silent drop this method exists to repair. The
        per-connection reader is strictly serial, so every later op from that
        viewer would queue behind the park as well (review round 1, R1-1).

        The ``is_streaming`` branch above does not cover it: the flag is still
        False during the drain's pre-streaming prelude (lock acquire, record
        and journal flushes), so a prompt sent moments before this lands in
        exactly that window.

        So the admission is DISPATCHED and this returns as soon as its outcome
        can no longer be reported synchronously. The refusals worth reporting —
        a closing session, a full queue, a rejected reservation — all raise in
        ``prompt``'s synchronous prelude, before it ever awaits, so they surface
        here and still become the warning receipt. Anything after that point is

        Reached from the desktop by ``POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/desktop/wakes``
        when a live runtime holds the session (see ``routes/desktop_wakes``),
        never by a user typing ``/wake``: the name is a routed-command word in
        the ladder above, not a registry entry, so no palette row exists for
        it and no terminal offers it. ``desktop_mcp`` and ``fork`` are the
        same shape of internal word.

        WHY THIS PATH EXISTS AT ALL. ``Session._persist_wake_schedules`` is
        the one writer of schedule state, and a live session republishes its
        WHOLE in-memory list on any change. An external write that appended a
        transcript row would therefore be overwritten by the session's next
        persist — while the supervisor, which skips any session with a live
        record, never fired it either. That is a silently dead reminder with a
        200 response, so the mutation has to happen in this process.

        The three helpers below are the SAME ones the agent's ``wake`` tool
        runs (``tools/builtin``), so a wake armed here and a wake armed by the
        model are validated and allocated identically; they end in
        ``scheduler.update`` -> ``_persist_wake_schedules``, which appends the
        transcript, rewrites the derived index and re-arms the timer. Edit has
        no twin on the tool because the tool's vocabulary is create/list/
        cancel — ``_wake_edit`` is that missing helper, and what an edit MEANS
        lives in ``build_wake_edit``, shared with the route-less arm path.

        attaching stamps the roster and both briefs onto the manager

        turn with no terminal open — the exact thing this release exists to
        make possible — was indistinguishable from an idle one.

        Driven from `_notify` rather than from a new observer because this

        surfaces that render "this session is working" (the sidebar's spinner,

        session holding a background job wore a spinner forever; see
        :meth:`is_conversationally_active` for the measurement.

        published on the record because a subagent graph is in-process state no
        other session can observe.

        The roster is ONE linear read: ``SubagentComms.status_counts()`` counts
        every nested descendant in a single pass over the shared registry, so
        counting is a filter over that histogram and must never have a
        recursive walk added on top — that would double count every node below
        depth 0. (The count used to be a filter over the ``nodes()`` LIST, which
        read as "one flat read" and was not: ``nodes()`` -> ``node()`` ->
        ``_describe()`` -> ``_live_twin()`` walked every record once per record,
        so this publisher was quadratic in the roster and ran on the event loop
        once per root event. See ``RosterPass``.) The statuses counted as
        running mirror the ones ``info.collect`` uses, so the record and this
        session's own tree cannot disagree.

        ``(None, None)`` on an unreadable roster rather than ``(0, 0)``: an
        unanswerable probe is not a measurement of zero, and the reader's
        lower-bound caveat depends on being able to tell the two apart.

        THIS IS NOW A REAL INVARIANT, and it was a lie for as long as

        asserting a hop that did not exist (the only ``run_coroutine_threadsafe``
        in ``server.py`` was ``close()``'s bounded join). An invariant that
        nothing enforces is worse than an absent one — the caller reads the
        claim, believes it, and the mistake ships as a wrong-thread TURN rather
        than as an error.

        Measured, which is why the enforcement matters (``probe_daemon_threaded.py``,
        the naive thread-hosted runtime): a ``prompt`` reached here from the
        runtime's thread and did two things at once — replied with an asyncio
        cross-loop error (``prompt`` created its ``admitted`` future on the
        session's loop and then ``asyncio.ensure_future``d the drain on the
        CALLER's, so the turn ran on the wrong thread) AND mutated the session
        anyway, leaving it un-disposable (the probe had to be killed at 150 s
        with the session's loop parked in ``select()``).

        WHO KEEPS IT TRUE: :func:`_on_session_loop`, which puts every public
        async body on the session's loop before this line runs, and
        ``RuntimeServer._handle_call_on_session_loop`` for the synchronous
        methods the registrant drives — the class docstring enumerates them, and
        that list is the single place they are named. So reaching here off-loop is now the
        EXCEPTION rather than the rule, and it means exactly one thing: the hop
        could not be made — no loop, or a loop already closed. That is not a
        state to run a session-mutating op in, so it is refused.

        A plain ``RuntimeError`` is the refusal, which is what the dispatcher's
        existing error-frame path already renders for a handle refusal — no new
        category, no ``error_code``, no wire change — and the sentence names the
