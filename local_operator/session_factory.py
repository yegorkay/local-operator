"""Session composition root for the CLI-facing entry points.

Why this module exists: ``cli.py`` (interactive + exec), ``exec_worker.py``
(detached background runs) and later the server facade all need the SAME
wiring from parsed args plus the three legacy managers to a harness
:class:`~local_operator.session.protocol.SessionProtocol`. Centralizing this
wiring keeps precedence rules, transcript-directory policy, lazy knowledge
integration, and the lazy-import discipline in exactly one place.

Constraints honored here (docs/REWRITE.md):

- No module-level imports of providers / session internals / semantic indexes /
  TUI. Every engine import happens inside functions, so importing this module
  is cheap and stays valid while parallel rewrite streams are mid-flight.
- Hosting/model resolution precedence: **agent > CLI flag > config file**
  (the legacy bootstrap order, minus the server-only request overrides).
- User skills and packaged guides are wired end-to-end: discovery + index build
  at session creation, first-task semantic selection, and chained
  ``skill://``/``guide://`` resolution. Any knowledge failure degrades to an
  empty listing with a warning — never a crashed startup.

``create_session`` is async: the TUI's committed factory contract is
``Callable[[], Awaitable[SessionProtocol]]`` and the eager skill-index build
needs an await. Headless callers wrap it in ``asyncio.run``.

MAX_USER_INSTRUCTIONS_CHARS = 64_000

#: Floor held for the selected agent's own profile prompt, so a large global

_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS_RESERVE = 16_000

#: Floor held for imported user-scope instructions (``~/.agents/AGENTS.md``;

#: adding a third source to a two-way split silently converts one of the two
#: existing guarantees into a shared one — the operator's file and the selected
#: profile would start evicting each other because of a file neither of them
#: knows about. Sized to match the profile's reserve: an imported file is
#: standing preference of the same kind and the same order of magnitude.
_ECOSYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_RESERVE = 16_000

#: Floor on a shared span before ``Overlaps:`` claims it is worth removing.
#: The containment test has no natural lower bound — a single ``-`` present in
#: both files is literal containment — and a WARNING row advertising a one-
#: character cost is exactly the warning operators learn to ignore, which is
#: the failure this row was added to avoid. 200 characters is roughly a
#: paragraph of standing rules: below it the row would cost more attention than
#: the duplication costs context (200 chars ≈ 50 tokens on the cached prefix,
#: and 0.3% of the 64,000-character budget), and no realistic shared rule set
#: is smaller. Deliberately not scaled to file size: the operator is being told
#: about an absolute cost re-paid on every request, not a ratio.
_OVERLAP_MIN_CHARS = 200


#: Modules whose import dominates :func:`create_session`, measured rather than
#: guessed: on this machine ``mcp`` costs 443 ms and ``httpx`` 234 ms to import,
#: and the engine entries below another 195 ms between them. Everything here is
#: imported lazily by the factory or by something it calls, which is what makes
#: session construction a ~700 ms burst of import machinery.
#:
#: Third-party names sit alongside our own deliberately: the cost is theirs, and
#: naming only our modules would warm the cheap half of the problem.
#:
#: ``tools.registry`` and ``classification`` were the two heaviest groups this
#: list still omitted, and their absence was measurable rather than theoretical:
#: with the entries below resident, the factory's own synchronous stretch still
#: measured a median 135.5 ms of CPU and 127.2 ms of CONTIGUOUS loop stall
#: (``_prepare``, interleaved arms, a fresh process and a matched idle control
#: per arm; raw output under ``.perf/bench/lane11/``). Warming these two as well
#: takes it to 81.6 ms and 77.3 ms — a median 53.9 ms of CPU and 55.8 ms of
#: stall less, in 4 of 4 interleaved pairs, against 187 and 33 modules left for
#: the factory to import. They are the same shape of work as every other entry
#: here — imported lazily by the factory or by something it calls, and never at
#: module scope (see ``test_import_graph.py``, which pins that importing this
#: module stays off these stacks).

    ``create_session`` is a coroutine, but its body is one long SYNCHRONOUS
    stretch — the awaits are few and none of them yield until the imports are
    done — so a caller with a live event loop is frozen for the whole of it.
    Under the TUI that is a ~700 ms window in which no frame is painted and no
    keypress is handled: the user types the first words of their prompt into a
    screen that does not move, and the characters all appear at once when it
    unfreezes.

    Importing is CPU and file I/O, both of which drop the GIL, so running this
    in a worker thread (``await asyncio.to_thread(warm_session_imports)``)
    turns that one long stall into interleaved sub-frame ones — measured at
    16 ms worst case, against 699 ms for the unwarmed factory. The factory
    itself is unchanged: it still imports what it needs, and finds it cached.

    The TOKENIZER rides along, and not for the same reason as the modules
    above: it is not an import, so nothing else warms it, but its first use
    sits inside the first turn's critical path all the same (122 ms to build
    cl100k_base's rank table — see
    :func:`local_operator.compaction.tokens.warm_tokenizer`). A TUI pays that
    cost once and keeps it; paying it at BOOT instead means the user's first
    prompt does not.

    Never raises. An optional extra that is not installed (``mcp``) or a module

    asymmetrically: "nothing configured" was a guided first-run state, while
    "configured to garbage" (a typo, a hand-edited config, a provider id
    removed by an upgrade) was a fatal crash. The user's remedy is IDENTICAL in
    both cases -- ``/login`` / ``/provider`` / ``/model`` from inside the app --

    Source of truth is ``<config_dir>/system_prompt.md`` — the same file the

    drift into separate notions of "custom instructions".

    ``agent_prompt`` is the selected agent profile's own ``system_prompt.md``.
    It is appended rather than allowed to replace the global file: an agent is
    a specialization ("you review Python"), not a reason to forget the
    operator's machine-wide preferences, and a profile that genuinely must
    override one can say so in its own text.

    Instructions shared with other agent tools (``~/.agents/AGENTS.md``, see
    :mod:`local_operator.ecosystem_instructions`) are read too, PREPENDED so
    the operator's own file is read last and wins on conflict, and skipped
    entirely when their content is identical to ``system_prompt.md`` — the
    common case for anyone who currently generates the native file from the
    shared one with a sync script. Those files are never written by lop, so
    ``system_prompt.md`` remains the single write target of Settings →
    Instructions and ``GET``/``PATCH /v1/config/system-prompt``.

    Failures degrade instead of breaking startup: an unreadable file is
    skipped, and undecodable bytes are REPLACED rather than dropping the whole
    file, because a stray bad byte in a long instructions file should cost the
    operator one glyph and not every preference they wrote. Either way a bad
    edit never costs a session.

    The result is bounded at :data:`MAX_USER_INSTRUCTIONS_CHARS`. This rides
    the CACHED head block, so it is re-sent as the prefix of every request in
    every session and every subagent: an accidentally huge file (a log pasted
    over the wrong path) would otherwise cost context and money on every call,
    and on a small-context model would fail the session at startup with
    nothing pointing at the cause. Truncation is explicit — the marker tells
    the model its instructions were cut rather than letting it act on half a
    rule — and a warning names the source and the limit.

#: around the call: killing a call the turn has stopped waiting for would throw away
#: an answer the next message could have used. Same pinning as above.
DEFAULT_CLASSIFICATION_TIMEOUT_MS = 1500

#: ``values.classification.waitMs`` — how long a TURN waits for a recommendation
#: before it stops waiting and lets the call finish in the background.
#:
#: This is the operator's latency budget in one number ("our own overhead under
#: 100 ms, ideally under 50 ms, per user message"), and it is deliberately NOT the
#: call's deadline: ``timeoutMs`` says how long the VENDOR may take, and on a real
#: roster that is ~250 ms median — waiting for it would put the vendor's model time
#: on the turn's critical path, which the budget explicitly excludes.
#:
#: WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS, measured on the real path (27-candidate roster, default
#: settings, ``scripts/classification_latency_probe.py``) and reported as the
#: DIFFERENCE against the layer being off, so the pre-existing cost of the turn path
#: is not claimed as ours:
#:
#: - a warm message against a VENDOR THAT DOES NOT ANSWER inside the wait costs the
#:   WAIT: **+50.9 to +52.1 ms median** over four runs (ON 52.75-53.80 ms, OFF
#:   1.69-2.73 ms). That is the number the budget is about, and it is bounded by
#:   ``waitMs`` — never by the vendor's ~250 ms answer, which is what puts this key
#:   between the turn and the model;
#: - a vendor that answers INSIDE the wait — a cache hit, or a leg that fails at once
#:   — costs **~0 to +2 ms**, because the turn stops waiting the moment it has an
#:   answer. Measured with a dead credential the whole steady state reads ~+0.4 ms for
#:   this reason, so a run must say which arm it measured (the committed script prints
#:   the service's own cost/skip lines and warns when nothing was delivered);
#: - a session's FIRST message costs **+22 to +32 ms** more (four runs here, 26.7-31.1
#:   ms in the reviewer's): one-off setup before the first await, which no wait budget
#:   can bound. It is NOT the client construction — the paired arms with and without
#:   ``ClassificationService.warm_up`` (which moves a measured tens-of-milliseconds
#:   first ``httpx.AsyncClient`` to session build) came out level at 30.7 vs 32.0 ms —
#:   and ``build_state`` measures 0.05 ms. Open in the contract, not explained here.
#:
#: So: an uncached message costs the wait the operator configured (~51 ms, inside the
#: 100 ms ceiling and AT the 50 ms ideal rather than under it), a message that finds an
#: answer already in hand costs ~nothing, and a session's first message pays a few tens
#: of milliseconds once. Anything slower than the wait is delivered by the next message
#: instead (see ``_harvest_classification``).
DEFAULT_CLASSIFICATION_WAIT_MS = 50

    THE WIRING RENDERS THIS, not the package's ``render_block``, and dedupe is

    what the embedder selected and what the MCP catalogue already advertises, and
    the wiring is the only layer that knows either. The package keeps its own
    renderer for callers with nothing to dedupe against.

    Anything already selected is dropped rather than demoted: a line telling the
    model to read what the skills block has just told it to read immediately is
    noise that costs context and teaches nothing.

    ``already`` is the SAME test one step further out: resources an earlier
    section of THIS prompt already carries. One turn can deliver two answers (the
    one a previous message harvested, then this message's own), and a shared
    ``limit`` — the per-message cap minus what has already been spent — is what
    keeps the pair inside ``maxRecommendations`` instead of doubling it.

    ``rendered_urls`` comes back through an OUT-LIST rather than a tuple return, and
    the reason is outside this module: ``tests/unit/classification/test_block_parity.py``
    compares this function's return value against the package's ``render_block`` line
    for line, and that comparison is worth more than a tidier signature. The caller
    needs the difference between what the recommendation CARRIED and what survived the
    dedupe or the cap — that is what feeds ``carried`` for the next answer in the same

    This is THE factory shared by ``cli.py`` (interactive TUI / headless

    (background exec). All engine modules are imported lazily inside; the
    caller only needs the three legacy managers plus an argparse namespace
    carrying ``hosting``, ``model``, ``agent_name``/``agent_id``, ``yolo``
    and ``train``.

    ``cwd`` is the session's working directory; ``None`` means the process
    cwd (legacy behaviour). Hosts that must relocate a session (the
    scheduler's per-agent directory) pass it explicitly instead of mutating
    the process-global cwd across awaits — every other session builder in
    the same process would otherwise read the wrong directory.

    ``defer_mcp_wiring`` is the TUI boot path's OPT-IN to having MCP servers
    wired in the background after the session is returned, so the first
    frame does not wait for the 250 ms discovery gate. Every other caller
    keeps the old contract — a returned session has MCP wiring completed
    (or degraded and recorded) — because headless/exec runs have no front
    end to re-read ``mcp_startup`` when the background round settles; they
    would silently miss both the tool merge and the failure report. The
    deferral is safe for the TUI only because MCP tools are lazy by default
    (see :func:`wire_mcp_into_session`): a turn started before wiring
    settles sees the same non-MCP tool surface as a session whose servers
    missed the gate today, and the ``refresh_selected`` merge lands
    mid-session exactly as a late ``list_changed`` event already does. A server
    that opted into ``preload_tools`` is no exception — its tools land through
    that same mid-session merge, one wiring pass later, because its schemas
    cannot exist before its connection does.

    ``mcp_publication_gate`` is the RUNTIME CHILD's half of that deferral,
    and it exists because deferring the dispatch did not defer the work. The
    background task's first instruction is a function-local import of the MCP
    SDK plus the config parse, and a task cannot run until the loop is free —
    in ``process.amain`` the first free instant is ``await
    _drain_inbox_into(handle)``, which sits BEFORE ``RecordPublisher``. So a
    declared server's SDK import ran to completion inside the pre-publication
    window anyway: measured 2.3 s on a machine with two servers declared, in
    14 of 14 runs, all of it before the record was written and therefore in
    front of the user. ``spawn_owned_session`` passes an event here and
    ``RuntimeServer._serve`` sets it the moment the record exists, so the
    wiring starts where ``serving.spawn_owned_session`` says it should —
    after the record, riding it.

    ``None`` means NO GATE, and that default is the whole safety of this change:
    a latch that applied to a caller which never publishes a record would park
    its MCP wiring for the session's life — MCP silently never wired, which is
    the failure the latch exists to prevent, arrived at from the other side. So
    the gate is only ever created by ``spawn_owned_session``, the one spawn site
    whose runtime publishes.

    Who exercises the ungated path in this tree: ``tests/`` (it is the default),
    and two operator scripts that build an in-process Session for a screenshot
    or a cleanup sweep (``scripts/evidence_session_cleanup.py``,
    ``scripts/cleanup_notice_shot.py``). The TUI process does NOT — on this
    release its owner path is gone from ``lop`` (see ``cli.py``'s "THE OWNER
    PATH IS GONE" note, which says the TUI process never builds a ``Session``)
    and no TUI code passes ``defer_mcp_wiring=True``, so nothing about the
    TUI's own import behaviour changes here. The ungated branch is kept as the
    default because it is the honest answer for a caller with no publisher,
    not because a TUI depends on it.

    Raises ``ValueError`` (caught by the CLI's red-banner handler) when the
    hosting/model configuration is missing.
