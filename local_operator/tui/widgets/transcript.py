"""Transcript container and the FINALIZED-BLOCK protocol.

The finalization protocol: blocks appended to the transcript
declare when they are done mutating. A block exposing ``is_finalized()`` is
treated as immutable by the container — its content is never updated again —
and ``settled_rows()`` reports how many of its rows are provably stable now
(used later for scroll accounting).

Spacing rhythm (the brand): blocks own NO uniform outer margin — the
container decides every gap. Separation is ADAPTIVE and opt-in: a block
takes a single blank row above it when the block before it was a different
KIND of thing, when that block rendered taller than one row, or when the
block itself is AIRY (:attr:`TranscriptBlock.SPACING_AIRY`). Tool rows are
airy: each one is a separate action, and stacked flush a run of them reads
as one wrapped block rather than as a ledger — reported from the field as
"there should be one line spacing between each". A list of one-line
notices still stacks tight, because that IS one thing said in parts. The
gap rides one CSS class (:data:`GAP_CLASS`); the base block selectors stay
margin-free so no "filler row everywhere" regression can slip back in, and
so the class can never be doubled by a margin underneath it.

Layout rhythm (D20): a user prompt carries a full-height ``▌`` rule in the
gutter column beside every one of its rows, and its prose sits two cells in,
exactly where the old ``❯ `` prefix put it. The gutter is shared, not owned —
a tool row leads at column 0 too, with its identity glyph — so the turn spine
reads from the SHAPE of each mark, a spanning bar against a single glyph.

    to ``rows`` and returns the tail that was left over (the caller's new
    ``current``).

    **Why the loop does not re-measure the suffix.** ``while cell_len(word) > width``
    re-scans the whole SHRINKING remainder on every pass while each pass removes only
    ``width`` cells, so the work is quadratic in the word's length: a 40,000-character
    token (a base64 blob, a minified line, a resolved path) cost 41,419 ``cell_len``
    calls measuring 10.1 M characters — 253x its own length — and 80,000 characters
    cost ~195 ms **on the TUI main thread**, i.e. a stalled frame per oversized token.
    The loop needs one bit from that scan: does the remainder still exceed ``width``?
    For a word whose cell widths are ADDITIVE it can have that bit for free, because
    the next pass's remainder is this pass's remainder minus the cells this pass
    removed (``remaining -= consumed``), and the whole word is measured once.

    Additivity is what the ``\u200d``/``\ufe0f`` test buys, and it is not an
    assumption about rich: with neither codepoint present, ``cell_len`` is its own
    documented per-character sum (``_cell_len``'s "simplest case", and the
    single-cell fast path agrees with it), for the word and so for every suffix of
    it. A word carrying either codepoint takes the ORIGINAL measured path instead,
    unchanged: there a cluster can measure WIDER than its characters (``1️⃣`` is 2,
    its characters sum to 1) or a joiner can swallow the next character, and one cell
    is the difference between a row that fits and one that overhangs its frame. The

        Every block here bakes its width into the rows it authors, so the one
        that matters is the width it will END UP at — not the one Textual has
        got round to assigning. A block is routinely given its content while
        it is still unmounted or mounted-but-not-yet-laid-out (the app builds
        a block, fills it, and appends it; the subagent page reconciles into a
        body that lays out one frame later), and in that window ``self.size``
        is 0. Falling straight to a hardcoded 80 there is what made a message
        fold narrow, pin that fold as its height, and then re-fold a frame
        later when the resize landed — a visible width flash on every mount
        into a terminal that is not 80 columns wide.

        The ladder walks from the most authoritative source down:

        1. the block's own laid-out width, once it has one;
        2. its container's, which Textual assigns before the child;
        3. the PARENT's scrollable content region, which is the width this
           block is about to be given — the transcript is a vertical container
           of ``width: 1fr`` blocks, so its scrollable content width (its own
           content box less any scrollbar gutter) is exactly the child's
           eventual width. Measured on the subagent page at 140x34: 134, which
           is the settled ``_built_width`` to the cell, at 100x30: 94, and at
           60x24 with a scrollbar up: 54;
        4. a :meth:`set_fold_hint` supplied by a builder that knows where this
           block is going, for a block built entirely detached — it has no
           parent to ask, so nothing above this rung can answer;
        5. ``fallback`` — reached only when nothing knows anything, i.e. a
           detached block in a unit test.

        It deliberately does NOT consult ``app.console.width``: that is the
        whole TERMINAL (175 in the harness above), never this block's column,
        so a block that trusted it would fold far too wide and clip.

        ``fallback`` is passed rather than read from a module constant because
        the three callers own different ones; they agree on 80 today, and this
        method is about ordering the sources, not about unifying the last step.

        * A class-body comprehension over ``BINDINGS`` sees only the list

class UserBlock(TranscriptBlock):
    """One user prompt behind a full-height rule in the gutter column.

    Reported from the field: "have user messages have a more obvious
    delineation […] consider that they will often be multi-line with
    paragraphs". The old treatment was a ``❯`` on the FIRST row only, so a
    three-paragraph prompt read as three assistant paragraphs the moment it
    wrapped — measured at 60 columns, even the opening paragraph lost its
    marker on its second row.

    The four decisions this block turns on, and why:

    **The rule runs down EVERY row**, wrapped continuations and the blank rows
    between paragraphs included. A marker that appears once marks a LINE; a
    marker on every row marks a BLOCK, and the block is what the reader is
    trying to find when scrolling back. The blank paragraph rows are the case
    that decides it: skip them and the rule breaks into segments, which is the
    same "three separate things" failure in a new costume.

    The strongest case for this is not prose but a PASTED SNIPPET, which is why
    the indentation is kept verbatim (see :meth:`_rows`). The rule sits OUTSIDE
    the text field — column 0-1, in a different ink — so the field has exactly
    one origin, at column 2, and every indent level measures from it. Without
    the bar, ``def f():`` two cells right of the assistant's column 0 is
    ambiguous: the reader cannot tell the app's indent from the paste's. With
    it, the bar says where the content field starts and the ladder inside is
    unmistakably the author's. A rule at column 2 with prose at 4, or prose left
    at 0, would have made the two systems share an origin and collide.

    **The prompt carries NO background.** Elevation-as-a-background-step is
    already spent, in full, on the tool ledger — every tool row is a filled
    slab, and that fill CARRIES the outcome. A second slab kind on the same
    surface makes the transcript a stack of cards and demotes the one element
    whose fill means something.

    A ``tint-user`` ground shipped briefly against that argument, on the
    grounds that a solved CHROMA cast is not an elevation step and so does not
    add a second slab KIND. The measurement held up — the cast moved mean
    ΔL* 0.39 where the ledger's fill moves 3.52 — and the frame still lost:
    a tinted band behind every prompt read as a slab regardless of the axis it
    was built on, and competed with the ledger for the same glance. Removed on
    review. The gutter bar already marks a prompt on every wrapped row and the
    adaptive ``.gap-above`` rule already brackets it; the ground was a third
    cue for something two were carrying.

    **The rule is ``dim``, not the accent**, and it does not need a hue to
    carry. What makes it read is EXTENT: it is the only CONTINUOUS multi-row
    column in the transcript. The gutter is not exclusive — ``ToolCard`` leads
    at column 0 too, and rightly, because that cell is the per-tool identity
    glyph and the ledger's leftmost scanning aid (measured at 80 columns: tool
    row lead 0, prompt lead 0, notice and working line lead
    :data:`SPINE_INDENT`). But a bar spanning every row of a block and a single
    glyph marking a single row are not confusable marks; they differ in shape,
    in ink, and in the whole structure of the row. Exclusivity was never what
    the design rested on.

    The accent is ruled out on its own budget: it is spent on exactly five
    sites (enumerated in ``local_operator.tcss``) and means "a turn is live", so
    a green column beside every prompt would be the largest accent surface in
    the app and would mean nothing. That argument stands and is why the rule is
    not the accent — but it was over-applied to mean the rule could carry no
    hue at all, and ``dim`` is the sheet's own SEPARATOR ink: the same grey as
    a list bullet and a settled tool row's command. The one element a reader
    scrolls back to find was drawn in the ink used for everything incidental.

    The rule is ``signal`` — the REFERENCE hue, "links, file paths", the things
    you go back and look at. A prompt is the reference case. It is spent on the
    RULE alone, which is the only CONTINUOUS multi-row column in the transcript
    and therefore the cheapest place a hue can go: one half-cell per row, no
    area, nothing tinted. ``▌`` (LEFT HALF BLOCK) buys the weight back through
    the GLYPH — half a cell of solid ink, where ``│`` would draw the left edge
    of a box the minimalism contract forbids. Held to the 3:1 floor a graphical
    object answers to, ``signal`` clears it in all 54 themes (worst 4.27:1,
    ``everforest-light``); ``dim``'s own 4.55:1 dark / 3.77:1 paper is what it
    replaces.

    **Spacing is unchanged.** :attr:`SPACING_LEAD` already opens a row above
    every prompt and the block below is always a different
    :attr:`SPACING_KIND`, so the existing adaptive rule brackets the rule with
    one row of GROUND on each side — which is precisely what keeps it reading
    as a sidebar rather than as a card with padding.

        change, and adaptive spacing gaps a multi-row block where it packs
        single-row ones — one prompt is one row at 120 columns and four at 60.

        The height change feeds back: rebuilding at a new width changes the row
        count, which is itself a resize, so one drag step costs TWO builds
        (measured: a 400-word prompt dragged 120→60 rebuilds at 56 cells twice,
        then settles — the second pass produces the same rows, so it converges
        rather than oscillating). A HEIGHT-only terminal resize costs none: the

        and `ToolCard.on_resize` document at length, and this block needs it for

        authored at its destination width (see `UserBlock.__init__`), so the
        mount's own 0→W resize — which every pinned height raises — now
        reproduces rows it has already been given. Measured for one page:
        `UserBlock` authored 18 times before the ladder fix, 12 after it, and 6
        with this guard, i.e. the guard removes the last build per block per
        mount. Safe because the rows are a pure function of the text, the
        attachment count and the width, all three fixed at construction — a
        prompt whose body changed is a new block — and `retheme` rebuilds
        directly without consulting this. The gap re-ask stays OUTSIDE the

        why this delegates to :meth:`refit_width` rather than inlining: the

    # rebuild only ever saw the STALE pre-resize width. Instrumented across

        ordinary character INSIDE a word, so it was measured into that word's
        width and then printed literally mid-row. ``/update``'s
        :func:`~local_operator.update.unknown_refusal` is six authored lines and
        came out as ``s.prefix:``, ``orted upgrades:``, ``px upgrade``,
        ``thon -m pip`` — issue #397. Three to four characters off the front of
        every line the author had indented, because the same helper rebuilds
        rows with a single separator and a LEADING run of spaces is dropped
        (the empty words never re-add their separator while ``current`` is
        still falsy). So the indent is lifted out before wrapping and put back
        on every row the line produces, which is what keeps ``  uv tool upgrade
        local-operator`` reading as one of three offered commands rather than as
        prose.

        This is :meth:`UserBlock._rows`'s discipline, arriving here for the
        reason that comment did not foresee: it fixed the split in the caller on
        the premise that notices "have no authored indentation to keep", and
        ``unknown_refusal`` authors both newlines and indentation. ``wrap_cells``
        itself still must not change — it also lays out tool rows, whose single
        space-joined strings would gain a newline-splitting branch none of them
        can reach.

        An authored break lands on the HANGING indent, exactly like a wrapped
        one. The glyph field is a gutter of fixed width, not a first-row prefix:
        :meth:`copy_gutter` returns :attr:`GLYPH_COLS` for every index, so a row
        that started at column 0 would have four cells of its own text stripped
        off a copy. Returning the author's line to the spine would also put it
        under the glyph rather than under the sentence, which reads as a second
        notice — the same "several statements instead of one" the hanging indent
        exists to prevent. The author's own indent then sits ON TOP of that
        gutter, so relative shape survives while the block stays one column.

        Blank rows are trimmed at the ENDS for the reason the split creates
        them: before this, a leading ``\\n`` was just a character, and now it is
        a row — one that would carry the kind glyph beside no text at all, with
        the sentence it marks on the row below. A trailing one is pinned height
        spent on nothing. Interior blanks stay: there a blank row is the
        paragraph break the author typed. At least one row always survives, so

        A notice is the one block whose text can exceed its row and whose author
        cannot know that in advance ("ctrl+c again to exit - resume with: …" grows
        with the session id). Left to Rich's own fold it wrapped to column ZERO —
        the gutter the composer's own ``❯`` lives in — so the app's two loudest
        rows (one keystroke from exit, and a disarmed approval gate) were also the
        two that broke the spine. Wrapping here keeps every continuation row under
        the first character of the text, which is what makes a long notice read as
        one statement instead of as several.

        A ``boot-column`` notice (one under the boot splash, an MCP server that
        failed to connect) wraps exactly the same way. It joins the centred boot
        composition as a BLOCK — the app gives it the card's width and offsets it
        onto the card's column (``OperatorApp._sync_boot_column_width``) — but its
        text keeps this one left edge, so the sentence starts on the composer's
        text column directly below it.

        It used to centre each row on its own width, and that is the one thing
        this method must not do again. The left edge of the ink then became a
        function of the sentence's LENGTH: a stack of three notices at 100 columns
        drew four different left edges (``[16, 17, 24, 31]``), a visible zigzag,
        and a wrapped continuation at 160 columns floated 34 cells right of its
        own first row as a centred orphan. ``welcome.py::_center_blocks`` rejected
        precisely this for the splash above it — "centring each line on its own
        width produced a diamond of four ragged edges" — and block-centres on ONE
        shared left edge instead. A notice is prose, not a centred mass like the
        wordmark or the card's caret, so it gets the same treatment: one column,
        found by the block's offset rather than by each row's own width.

    A wake fires with no user keystroke, so before this block the transcript
    showed the agent simply starting to work — the cause (which wake, saying
    what) existed only in the model's context. The receipt that closes that
    gap has to be findable the same way a tool row is: a filled one-line
    card, a blank row of air above and below, and an expand affordance that
    lights on hover/focus rather than a dim trailing word that reads as
    caption. The collapsed line names the schedule; the expansion is the
    delivered prompt (Enter / click / Space), the same contract the tool
    ledger uses.

    It is a ledger row on purpose. Sharing :attr:`SPACING_KIND` with
    :class:`~local_operator.tui.widgets.tool_card.ToolCard` plus

    when it sits between notices — the previous notice-kind line stacked
    flush with the quota warnings around it and disappeared into them.

    Control-sequence removal is :func:`local_operator.ansi.
    strip_control_sequences`, the helper the tool ledger already uses

    This is deliberately NOT a :class:`UserBlock`: it must read as *inbound
    cross-session* — a note the user did not type and the schedule did not
    fire, but that another running session handed over. It IS drawn as a
    ledger card, the same shape :class:`WakeBlock` uses, and that is the fix
    this class exists in its present form for.

    **Why the card replaced the rule-and-header block.** The receipt used to
    paint a full-height ``↔`` gutter rule, a wrapped sender header, and then
    the WHOLE body at body weight. That is right for one message and wrong for
    the traffic this harness actually carries: a single release-window
    announcement from a peer measured **15 rows at 100 columns**, and two of
    them pushed the conversation the user was reading off the top of the
    screen. An inbound note is a RECEIPT — something arrived, from whom, about
    what — and a receipt earns one line until the reader asks for more. So the
    collapsed row names the sender and previews the message, and Enter / click
    / Space reveals the full sender identity and the whole body, exactly the
    contract every other action row in the ledger offers.

    It is a ledger row on purpose, for the reasons :class:`WakeBlock`'s
    docstring gives: sharing :attr:`SPACING_KIND` with the tool card plus
    :attr:`SPACING_AIRY` is what puts a blank row above and below it, and
    ``LEDGER_ROW`` keeps its name column aligned with the tool rows a peer
    message habitually lands between. A receipt sitting in a run of actions
    with its own private layout is a second spine.

    **The name leads the snippet.** ``_send_summary`` in ``tool_card.py``
    learned this the expensive way: the row builder truncates the composed
    summary from the right as ONE string, so whatever sits rightmost dies
    first. WHO reached in is what the reader acts on — it is the address they
    would answer at — and free text is the thing that can be shed without the
    row becoming unidentifiable, so the sender leads and the snippet trails.

    The summary row is app chrome (the app naming the sender), so it is
    excluded from a copy the same way :class:`UserBlock`'s attachment receipt
    is; :meth:`text` and the expanded body stay the peer's verbatim message.

        #: literally mid-row.
        #:
        #: Sliced before sanitizing, and the slice is deliberately far larger
        #: than any row: `truncate_cells` walks the string it is given, so a
        #: 256 KiB snippet cost 0.89 ms per repaint even once the strip was
        #: cached. `_SNIPPET_SOURCE_MAX_CHARS` cells cannot be reached by a row
        #: (`TOOL_NAME_COL_MAX` plus a terminal's width is orders of magnitude
        #: below it), so this bounds the work without being a second truncation
        #: rule that could disagree with the row's own. Only the PREVIEW is

        ``clock_from`` overrides the phase's zero with one the caller measured,
        for the case where the phase outlives the work it names. A running batch
        keeps the phase at ``running`` as it sheds calls, so a batch that
        narrowed to its youngest call went on counting from the batch's start
        while naming only the survivor — a ``read`` printing ``0s`` on its own
        receipt one line above a band reading ``running read  14s`` (design
        round 3, D9). The caller passes the oldest start among the cards the
        label covers, so the number describes the work named rather than the
        phase containing it. ``None`` keeps the phase's own zero, which is right
        for every state whose label and phase begin together.

        ``clock_from_epoch`` is the same override for the phases whose zero the
        WIDGET cannot have observed — ``thinking``, ``responding`` and
        ``composing`` — where the session folded the instant the phase began
        from the producer's own events. It is what makes a viewer that attaches
        mid-turn resume the true age: this row is constructed at the switch, so
        its phase zero is the switch, and without the seed the operator's own
        report applies — the thinking indicator counting from the moment they
        came back rather than from when the model call started.

        It is converted to a monotonic instant ONCE, here, on the phase change
        (:func:`tool_card.monotonic_from_epoch`), and every tick afterwards
        counts on ``time.monotonic``: an elapsed-time reading must not move
        because something adjusted the system clock, and a DST jump on a
        seeded row would be a number nobody could explain. ``clock_from_epoch``
        wins over ``clock_from`` when both arrive; the two describe different
        phases and the caller only ever passes the one that matches.

        ``clock=False`` says the caller knows the LABEL but not when the work it
        names began, and the number is then withheld rather than counted from
        this moment. The case that forced it: a sidebar switch adopts a tool the
        owner has been executing for half an hour, so the phase becomes
        ``running <tool>`` here — at the instant of the switch. The clock is
        phase-keyed, so it restarted, and the band read ``running await_job 2s``
        beside a card that had deliberately blanked its own duration for exactly
        this reason (design review round 2, D6). Naming the tool is what makes
        the adjacent number read as a claim ABOUT that tool, so the label is
        kept and the clock is dropped: this row's whole contract is that every
        number on it was derived from an event the app received, and a clock
        started from the wrong zero is worse than no clock.

        Withholding is still the answer whenever the true age is genuinely
        unavailable, and that is a real population rather than a hypothetical:
        a call whose producer sent no ``started_at_epoch`` (an older runtime),
        and every child row inside ``subagent_view``. For those the timestamp
        does not exist on this surface at any price, so the number is withheld
        rather than invented — ``clock=False``, which paints NO clock glyph at
        all (``_clock_text`` still computes a nominal ``0s``; what drops it is
        :meth:`_paint`'s ``if self._clock`` gate) while the glyph's cells stay
        reserved, so the label beside it clips at the same column it would
        otherwise. No glyph and a number counting up from zero are different
        pictures, and which one a phase gets is a decision the next paragraph
        makes separately rather than a side effect of it.

        A fold that does not match the phase the app derived withholds the
        SEED, not the number, and the row counts from its own phase zero
        instead. A facade with no fold and a legacy owner land there; so do
        the compaction and retry fallbacks, and for those that zero is the
        honest reading rather than a substitute for one. The seed exists to
        repair a zero this widget cannot have observed
        (:meth:`_seed_clock_from_epoch`), so its absence says nothing about
        the phase's own zero — the instant this row entered its phase, true
        for every state whose label and phase begin together and never another
        phase's age — and the fallbacks are exactly such a state.
        ``OperatorApp._current_activity`` returns the label AS the phase for
        ``compacting context`` and ``retrying (attempt n)`` precisely because
        the fold models no compaction or retry edge, so the phase starts when
        the app derived it from the event that began the pass, and the ``0s``
        growing under that label IS the age of the pass the label names.
        Withholding answers the other case — the label arriving at an instant
        that is not the work's start, as the adopted tool above does — so a
        mismatch is never a reason to blank a row that is telling the truth;
        the matching rules live in ``OperatorApp._current_activity``.

        The clock restarts only when the PHASE changes, not whenever the label
        does. Keying it to the rendered string made the row refute itself: one
        call of a three-call batch settling showed ``✓ 4.0s`` on its receipt
        while the line two rows below reset to ``running 2 tools  0s``, and a
        batch that shed a call every twenty seconds could never show a clock
        past twenty — which is exactly the "has this been stuck" question the
        clock exists to answer. A count changing, a tool name arriving in
        fragments and an intent being revised are all the same phase.

        ``rm -rf /tmp/x`` is unanswered, and ``app.focused`` became
        ``TranscriptView`` with the prompt still up and unanswered underneath
        it. The same click while the ``/btw`` aside is open leaves the
        composer un-focusable for the rest of the gesture — see
        :meth:`on_key`'s guard, which refuses to rescue a keystroke for
        exactly this reason, and which this method is the other half of. One
        predicate, two doors: :meth:`on_key` guards what happens to a
        keystroke arriving AFTER focus lands here; this guards whether focus
        is allowed to land here AT ALL.

        Read-only where it can be. ``focus_is_claimed`` is the exact question
        Textual is here answering "yes, focus me" to on its own — the widget
        is not stealing the claim's OWN say, only declining Textual's default
        one when nothing else has agreed to give the keyboard up. When
        nothing claims it (the ordinary case, no approval/ask/aside/etc. up),
        this returns True and the container still becomes the fallback focus
        target exactly as before — :meth:`on_click` then redirects it to the
        composer.

        the 1-cell target reads as grabbable before the grab. Textual already

        ``Click`` bubbles from the widget under the pointer, a row that
        legitimately takes the click stops it (:meth:`ExpandableActionBlock.
        on_click` on activation), and a stopped event never reaches here at

        claimed — except that MouseDown's own focus walk runs before any of
        that: Textual focuses the nearest FOCUSABLE ancestor under the
        pointer, and a row with no document position of its own
        (``UserBlock``, ``AssistantBlock``, a settled ``ToolCard`` with
        nothing to expand) has none, so the walk lands on this container.
        ``event.widget`` is that row — a ``TranscriptBlock`` — and the old
        guard bailed out on exactly that widget, leaving focus stranded here
        with no rescue. Measured: click a plain conversation row (no aside, no
        approval, nothing else open) and ``app.focused`` stays
        ``TranscriptView`` — the same class of defect
        :meth:`OperatorApp._focus_is_claimed` exists to prevent on the Esc

        ``self.has_focus`` reads the ANSWER to "did something else end up

        holding it by default, and this correctly redirects.

        Ordinary history inserts at zero. A subagent with a synthetic delegation
        keeps that fixed prefix and inserts at one. The anchor is the retained
        block containing the viewport top plus its intra-block offset, never a
        virtual-height proxy: adaptive gap settlement can legitimately change
        heights above it on a later layout pass.

        ``on_settled`` runs after the insert is fully answered — gaps settled
        AND the anchor restore's own non-animated scroll has landed — which is
        the earliest moment a caller that gates work on "the reader is back
        where they were" can safely re-open that gate. Running it from the
        anchor restore rather than the settle itself is load-bearing: the
        restore is the last thing that touches the offset. It runs INSIDE the
        restore's programmatic-scroll guard so the gate never opens on a frame
        where this widget's own scroll could still be reported as a reader's
        (see ``restore_anchor``).

        THE INVARIANT, and why the restore alone did not deliver it: mounting
        rows ABOVE the viewport moves the reader's content down the virtual
        canvas by the inserted extent, so the offset must move by exactly the
        same amount for the content under the reader's eyes to stay still.
        Those two happen at different times. The extent grows as each mounted
        block authors its height (``_set_authored_height``), over SEVERAL
        layout passes; a restore scheduled for the end of that sequence leaves
        every intermediate frame painted at the old offset against a taller
        canvas — the reader watches the transcript lurch down and snap back.
        Measured on a 401-message resume before this change: the anchor gap
        (anchor top minus ``scroll_y``, invariant under a correct insert)
        excursed to **120 rows on a 31-row viewport** — nearly four screens —
        across three painted frames before the restore returned it to 0.

        So the anchor is held for the WHOLE settle in ``_insert_anchor`` and
        re-applied by :meth:`_size_updated` on every extent change, which is
        the same frame the growth lands in. The deferred restore is kept as
        the final correction (and as the ``on_settled`` seam), but by the time
        it runs the offset is already right and it is a no-op. This is the
        same class of bug ``_land_on_tail`` documents for the tail direction:
        one late correction against an extent that is still moving.

        append can only ever widen and can answer that in O(1) (see its
        docstring); everything else goes through here, because only a re-scan
        can say which way the width moved.

        Each of those paths used to carry its own idea of what to do — most
        dropped the derived width and repainted nobody, and the append's growth
        path returned early whenever the width was unset, which is exactly the
        state those drops leave — so rows kept the old offset until a pointer
        happened to hover them. That is the tear a reader saw moving the cursor
        down the ledger, and again on revealing an older page.

        The comparison is against the width the rows were actually published
        with, :attr:`_name_col_applied` — never against the cache, which the

        The lane is the width a block is given, and a block bakes that width
        into the rows it authors — so a row that keeps an older one is a full-
        width widget whose content stops short of its own right edge, with the
        status tail stranded mid-row. That is the tear this exists to prevent,
        and it is reachable because the notification a row would rely on,
        ``Resize``, is not delivered in one specific frame:

        * A widget's layout request reaches the Screen ASYNCHRONOUSLY
          (``Widget._check_refresh`` posts ``messages.Layout``; ``Screen._on_layout``
          is what fills ``_layout_widgets``). In the window before that message
          is processed, ``Screen._refresh_layout(scroll=True)`` — the pass a
          pending wheel scroll triggers — takes ``Compositor.reflow_visible``,
          the visible-only arrangement. A sidebar toggle (or any lane change)
          that lands in that window is therefore serviced by the VISIBLE-ONLY
          branch: only the widgets newly EXPOSED by it get ``_size_updated`` and
          a ``Resize``, so every already-visible row keeps the width it was
          authored at while the compositor paints it at the new one.
        * ``reflow_visible`` leaves ``_full_map_invalidated`` set, and the lazy
          ``full_map`` read that follows (any ``Widget.size``/``region`` lookup
          on a widget the visible map does not hold, plus the app's own
          measuring) re-arranges at the NEW size and stores that as
          ``_full_map``. The corrective full reflow then compares against it,
          finds nothing changed, and sends ``Resize`` to NOBODY — the map's
          membership decides what is resized (``shown | resized``,
          ``screen.py:1365-1377``), not ``_size_updated``'s return value, so not
          even a widget whose size hook just answered "changed" is told. The
          narrow content is then permanent until something else happens to call
          ``refresh_row`` (a hover, which is exactly the operator's one-row-at-
          a-time cure).

        Being keyed on this container's OWN reconciled geometry is what makes
        the rule hold for lane changes nobody enumerated: a docked sidebar, its
        overlay threshold, a settings position change, a boot-column sync, a
        terminal resize. The container is told about its own size in
        :meth:`_size_updated` even when the rows are not, and ``changed`` there
        is exactly "my geometry moved". Two limits of that gate are recorded
        here rather than papered over:

        * A SCROLLBAR-GUTTER-ONLY move can change ``scrollable_content_region``
          (the lane) without this container's own ``_size`` moving, and so does
          not reach here (R3, review round 1). It does not need to: a thumb
          appearing is a reflow of its own, the rows are re-fitted through their
          ordinary ``Resize`` on it, and review could not produce a tear from
          one — the content growing enough to raise a thumb moves
          ``virtual_size``/``container_size`` with it, which is a geometry
          change like any other. Widening the gate to cover it would mean
          reading ``scrollable_content_region`` on every ``_size_updated``,
          including the passes that moved nothing.
        * The correction lands in the pass AFTER the lane change (D2, design
          round 1): a frame captured in the same tick as
          ``action_toggle_sidebar`` still shows the old width, and one
          event-loop turn later it does not. That is inherent rather than a
          defect — the container has to be RECONCILED at the new lane before it
          can publish it, and the pass that moved the lane may be one this
          container is not in (the visible-only pass visits the widgets it
          exposed, not the ones already on screen). The gap is therefore bounded
          by one message-loop turn, and this code cannot close it: ``Screen``'s
          update timer is a callback timer (``Timer._tick`` awaits
          ``_on_timer_update`` directly, not through the queue), so a live
          terminal is not *provably* unable to paint inside that window. What it
          cannot do is keep the tear, which is what was actually reported: a
          stale row that survived settles and needed a hover to heal. Round 2
          measured it directly with a display probe (every ``App._display`` of
          the sequence): the clean toggle path paints ZERO torn frames where
          the previous head painted one (D1's prose tear), and the raced path —
          a manual ``_refresh_layout(scroll=True)`` in the toggle's own tick —
          hands the display exactly ONE, self-correcting on the next pass
          (D2, design round 2, rated MINOR for being measured rather than
          assumed). Deliberately NOT suppressed by
          ``_suppress_intermediate_paint``: that idiom stands in for
          ``_compositor_refresh`` around an app-initiated, synchronous
          ``_refresh_layout()`` (the ``/resume`` switch), and this frame comes
          out of Textual's OWN scroll-triggered timer pass, which no call site
          here owns — using it here would mean suppressing paints for an
          unbounded window until an event this code cannot see, which is a
          worse failure than one intermediate frame. Recorded as a bounded
          residual on the thread rather than fixed.

        The ``scrollable_content_region`` read below is a compositor-map lookup,
        and with ``_full_map_invalidated`` still set in this frame it re-arranges
        the whole tree from inside ``Screen._refresh_layout``'s iteration over
        its captured layer list (R2, review round 1). Deliberate and bounded:
        one arrangement per LANE change, attributed by review as
        ``full:inside_refit_lane: 1``, and arrangement counts are at parity with
        the base tree (51 vs 50 across an 8-step resize drag) because this
        replaces the per-row ``Resize`` the base tree spent on the same pass. The
        screen iterates the list it captured, and the map the lane is then taken
        from is the new geometry — which is what makes the lane authoritative
        here rather than a second opinion.

        Cost is one O(rows) walk per LANE change (a toggle or a resize, not a
        frame): each row compares the published lane against ``_built_width``
        and returns untouched when it already matches, so a lane change only
        rebuilds the rows that the missing ``Resize`` left behind.

        Coverage is not ledger-only: the same missing notification strands a
        block that authors its rows at a width — a wrapping ``UserBlock`` prompt
        stays wrapped for the old lane inside the new box, which is the same
        two-right-edges frame one block type over — so
        :meth:`_refit_authored_blocks` is walked here too.

        truncates its own text bakes the lane into its content, so a lane change
        it is not told about leaves it authoring for a width it no longer has.
        Measured on the base tree in this exact frame, with a wrapping prompt at
        the bottom of a 40-row ledger: the ledger rows were left narrow and so
        was the prompt, and on the head before this walk existed the rows were
        repaired while the prompt stayed wrapped for the 79-cell lane inside a
        126-cell box — prose stopping ~50 cells short of the tool rows directly
        above it, in one viewport, which is the operator's "some lines will be
        full width and some won't" one block type over. ``NoticeBlock`` and the
        working line share the shape (both re-author through ``on_resize``, the
        notification this window drops); ``RichBlock`` does not, and most blocks
        never will — the base :meth:`TranscriptBlock.refit_width` is a no-op, so
        a block with nothing to re-fit costs one attribute lookup.

        Skipped when unmounted, for the reason the ledger walk records: a block
        that is not a child of this container is not on screen to be torn and
        derives on its own first layout, and one being re-parented mid-pass must
        not be re-authored from a stale position.

        Each block is asked for the width it should be fitted to
        (:meth:`TranscriptBlock.authored_width`) rather than handed the lane
        directly, because the lane is only the box of a block that fills its
        row. A block that pins its own box answers with that box: publishing
        the lane to a boot-column notice authored it wider than the box it is
        painted in, and made the walk and the block's own ``Resize`` name two
        different widths for one lane change (R1, review round 2 / Q-R2-1, QA
        round 2). The base answers the lane unchanged, so every other block
        still receives the container's number verbatim.

        Two limits are recorded rather than papered over. The walk is cheap by
        INHERITANCE, not by construction (R3, review round 2): ``ImageBlock``,
        ``ApprovalBlock`` and ``KeyPromptBlock`` re-author on every lane change
        whether or not their own width moved, each for a reason its own
        docstring gives (no cheaper staleness test for a grid or a receipt row),
        so a lane change costs those two builds of one-row blocks and the cost
        is linear in lane changes rather than multiplicative. And the walk sees
        ``self._blocks`` only, so a width-authoring child mounted around
        ``append_block`` — the boot ``welcome`` splash
        (``app.py`` mounts it ``before=0``) — is outside it by construction (R4,
        review round 2, recorded and not measured: the splash re-fits in its own
        ``on_resize``); a second walk over ``children`` would have to answer for
        every non-block widget the container ever holds.
