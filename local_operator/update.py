"""PyPI-facing updater for the installed ``local-operator`` distribution.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
End users install from PyPI (``uv tool``, pipx, or pip). They need one
command that upgrades whatever they actually have, without being pointed at
``lop-update`` — that script archives local git ``main`` into the uv-tool
env, which is the opposite audience.

"Latest" is always ``https://pypi.org/pypi/local-operator/json`` →
``info.version``, compared to ``importlib.metadata.version("local-operator")``.
That is the same source the splash version row and ``lop --version`` already
use. A second version channel (git tags, ``lop-update``, a pin file) would
diverge from what the running process reports.

WHY THE CACHE
-------------
The splash paints immediately and a background probe fills an optional ``!``
row. Hitting PyPI on every launch would stall a flaky network under the first
frame and turn a quiet check into a toast. Modelled on
``model/catalogue.py``: fresh cache skips the network, a stale copy is kept
when the fetch fails, and a total miss is ``None`` — never an error the user
has to dismiss. The probe is news, not a prerequisite, so it must not compete
with the credentials-fallback line.

``/update`` and ``lop update`` bypass the TTL (they need a live answer) but
still rewrite the cache so the next splash is free.

    ``pyproject.toml`` moves, so a checkout at 0.49.0 kept reporting the
    0.46.23 it had been installed at -- and the app showed that stale number to
    users in Settings > Updates (QA Q3 / UX U13).

    PRECEDENCE: the checkout's ``pyproject.toml`` when that checkout IS this
    install (an editable install, verified through ``direct_url.json`` by

    Not a maximum. This used to take the HIGHER of the two, on the argument that
    both are stale in opposite directions -- metadata never moves with the tree,
    while a stray ``pyproject.toml`` declaring an older version produced a
    spurious "update available" (review round 2, MINOR-2) -- and that a maximum
    therefore failed in the SAFE direction.

    both, because the real defect was never the comparison: it was trusting a
    file whose relationship to the running code had not been established. On a
    real install a spawned child read a 0.51.0 checkout while running 0.51.5,
    and the maximum could not help -- the wrong input simply won or lost on
    magnitude.

    Once the source side is required to prove identity, the two are no longer
    rival guesses about one unknown: a matched checkout is the live version of
    the code that is executing and its metadata is a snapshot of an earlier
    state, so the checkout is authoritative outright and the ordering is
    irrelevant. When nothing proves identity there is only one input left.

    A packaged (non-editable) install has no editable ``direct_url.json``, so it

    IDENTITY, NOT ADJACENCY. This previously trusted any ``pyproject.toml``
    sitting beside the imported package, on the reasoning that a released build
    has no adjacent project file and so could never read a stray one. That

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    ``perform_upgrade`` replaced the payload under ``root`` and nothing wrote
    the marker back, so the file kept describing the build it had DISPLACED.
    On the reporting host that left ``.lop-source`` naming the 0.51.7 bump
    commit while site-packages carried 0.51.9 — every ``version@ref`` label,
    every :class:`BuildStamp` comparison and the settle clock below all read
    from a file about a build that was no longer there.

    THE FORMAT IS A CONTRACT WITH A SECOND WRITER
    ---------------------------------------------
    ``~/.local/bin/lop-update`` (a shell script, out of this tree) writes
    ``printf '%s %s\\n' "$COMMIT" "$REF"``. That shape is preserved exactly, so
    the two writers stay interchangeable and neither has to know about the
    other; :func:`source_ref` discriminates on token shape, not on which writer
    produced the line. A PyPI upgrade has no commit, so it writes
    ``pypi <version>`` — honest about having no ref rather than carrying the
    previous install's sha forward.

    ``origin`` is the first token for an install that is NOT a PyPI wheel and
    has no commit to name (a locally built directory passed to ``lop update
    --from-snapshot``). It must not be hex or it would read as a commit — see
    :func:`_looks_like_git_sha`, which anticipates exactly this — and any
    reader that does not recognise it degrades to "no ref", which for such an
    install is the truth.

    ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING
    ------------------------
    Callers must write this only AFTER the installer has exited successfully.
    :func:`build_marker_age_s` uses this file's mtime as the moment the install
    became whole, and a runtime that acted on a marker written mid-install
    could spawn a successor that imports a torn tree.

    ATOMIC, AND BEST-EFFORT
    -----------------------
    Temp-and-rename within the destination directory, mirroring
    :func:`_write_cache`: a torn or interrupted write cannot leave a partial
    marker behind, which matters because ``RuntimeServer.__init__`` reads this
    file and a corrupt one would otherwise reach every runtime on the host
    (review round 1, R1-2). A failure to write returns ``False`` rather than
    raising — a missing marker degrades to "compare on version alone", while a
    failed upgrade report would be a worse outcome than an unrecorded one.

    THE LEGACY SHAPE, KEPT AS A SAFETY NET. It was written for a layout that
    replaced the installed tree IN PLACE — ``lop-update`` and
    :func:`perform_upgrade` writing 929 files over the tree a long-lived process
    was importing from — so a process that loaded the old build could hit a lazy
    ``from local_operator… import x`` the new tree no longer satisfied. The
    observed shape was precise: the module still resolved, the NAME did not
    (``ImportError: cannot import name '_journal_injection_ids' from
    'local_operator.session.runtime.transcript'``, 605 times on one machine's log).

    In-place replacement is no longer how the uv-tool install works: each build
    lands in its OWN generation and a running process's tree is never rewritten
    (see ``local_operator.update``'s layout section). So for such a process this
    classifier now answers ``None`` by construction, and correctly: its own tree
    did not move, so an ImportError IS ours and must stay an ordinary
    traceback. It is kept because three populations still have the old shape and
    a half-replaced tree is exactly what they would see — a pip/pipx install
    (neither has a layout this product can make atomic), a process launched
    before this machine migrated, and a ``lop`` started out of the old fixed
    uv-tool tree.

    What separates that from a genuine packaging bug is the STAMP MOVING UNDER
    THE PROCESS. If the install on disk still matches the build this process
    booted from, the miss is ours and must stay an ordinary traceback — so
    ``None``. ``installed_build`` is the right question here rather than
    ``disk_build``: it asks whether THIS process's tree moved, and a pointer
    that moved onto another generation is not that (the files this process
    imports were never touched). A ``boot`` we could not read (``None``) also
    answers ``None``: without a baseline there is nothing to compare, and
    guessing here would relabel a real packaging error as an install race.

    ``module`` is what the CALLER was importing, used when the exception itself
    names nothing (some wrappers drop ``name``).

    ``recorded_boot`` IS THE DURABLE SECOND OPINION, consulted ONLY when the
    live stamp is unavailable. ``session/runtime/journal.py`` publishes a boot
    record per runtime (``run/host/<pid>.json``) holding the build that process
    was born on, and which survives precisely the case this function exists to
    name: an install torn badly enough that ``installed_build()`` — which reads
    the dist-info directory and ``.lop-source`` off the very tree being
    replaced — cannot answer. Before this, that case fell to ``boot is None``
    and the tear was reported as a genuine packaging bug.

    The live stamp still WINS whenever it is readable, and not as a matter of
    taste: it is the same process's own reading at the same instant, while the
    recorded one is a snapshot from boot time. Consulting the record first would
    make a process that has legitimately been re-pointed at a new install
    compare against a stale baseline. When neither is readable the answer stays
    ``None``, which is the legacy path unchanged.

    The settle input for a runtime's self-refresh (``process._build_changed``):
    an installer rewrites site-packages over several seconds, and a runtime
    that acted inside that window could spawn a successor importing a torn
    tree. Two files record when the install was last touched: ``.lop-source``,
    written last by both writers (``lop-update`` and
    :func:`write_source_marker`) precisely so it marks the moment the install
    became whole, and the ``dist-info`` directory, written last by the
    installer itself.

    WHY THE NEWEST OF THE TWO, NOT THE MARKER FIRST
    -----------------------------------------------
    Reading the marker first and the dist-info only as a fallback assumed the
    marker is rewritten whenever the payload is — which was not true before
    :func:`write_source_marker` existed, and still is not for an install
    upgraded by some path that writes neither (a hand-run ``uv tool install
    --force``). A marker older than the payload then reported a minutes-old
    install as hours old: on the reporting host, ~19000 s for a tree written
    minutes earlier, which is the settle guard reading the wrong clock and
    disarming itself exactly when it was needed.

    Taking the MOST RECENT of the two mtimes cannot have that failure: any
    write to either file only makes the reported age smaller, and a smaller
    age means the guard waits longer. Erring toward "not settled yet" is the
    safe direction — the cost is one more refresh check, against the cost of
    spawning from a half-written tree.

    ``None`` when neither can be read — an editable checkout has no dist-info
    of its own and no marker, and the caller treats "unknown" as "not
    settled", which is the same safe side.

    THE TWO TERMS ARE NOT SCOPED THE SAME WAY, ON PURPOSE
    -----------------------------------------------------
    The marker is read from ``prefix``; the dist-info is always the RUNNING
    INTERPRETER's, because :func:`distribution` resolves through ``sys.path``
    and takes no prefix. In the PRE-generation layout the two were the same
    tree — a runtime's ``prefix`` WAS its own install — so the distinction was
    invisible. It is visible in exactly two shapes now, and both are safe:
    the ``LOP_BUILD_PREFIX`` test seam, where a caller passing a foreign prefix
    gets an age mixing that prefix's marker with this interpreter's dist-info
    (review round 1, R1-2); and the generation layout's disk read, where the
    marker comes from the generation the POINTER names and the dist-info from
    this process's own — an OLDER mtime, so the max is still the fresh marker
    and the settle asks exactly the question it is meant to ("has the install
    the pointer just moved to stopped being written?").

    That is deliberate rather than merely tolerated. Scoping the dist-info to
    ``prefix`` means globbing ``<prefix>/lib/*/site-packages/*.dist-info``,
    and a layout that glob does not match degrades this back to reading the
    MARKER ALONE — which is precisely the stale-marker failure the max-of-two
    was introduced to fix, reintroduced on the production path to sharpen a
    seam only the e2e stage uses. The mixed answer is also safe in the one
    direction that matters: an extra mtime can only make the age SMALLER, so
    the settle guard waits longer, never less.

# Nothing a running process holds is ever rewritten: its ``sys.path`` names the
# generation it was launched from, and superseding it is a temp symlink plus
# ``os.rename`` — atomic, with no instant at which ``current`` is absent or
# unresolved. A ``lop`` exec that races the flip therefore resolves either the
# old generation or the new one, never nothing.
#
# RESOLUTION IS DONE BY THE KERNEL, NOT BY ``pwd``. ``~/.local/bin/lop`` is a
# symlink chain and a uv console script's shebang names its OWN generation's
# interpreter ABSOLUTELY, so the child's ``sys.prefix`` comes out concrete
# (verified: launching ``<gen>/tools/local-operator/bin/python3`` through
# ``current`` reports the pointer path, because CPython detects a venv from the
# invoked path's parent directory — which is why the spawn sites resolve the
# pointer themselves rather than handing ``current`` to a child; see
# :func:`current_interpreter`).
#
# WHAT THIS MAKES OF THE OLD DEFENCES. The build watch, the settle window and
# the files-gone probe all still exist and still work; after this they are a
# CONVERGENCE path rather than a safety path. A mixed-generation fleet is an
# accepted steady state: a runtime older than ``current`` keeps serving until it
# goes idle, and the next engage constructs on the current build.

#: The stable root. Deliberately NOT under ``~/.local/share/uv/tools``: uv owns
#: that tree and rewrites it, which is the whole incident. Read through
#: ``Path(_STABLE_ROOT).expanduser()`` at every use so a redirected ``HOME``
#: (an isolated test, a sandbox) moves it — an absolute path captured at import
#: time would write into the operator's real home from inside a sandbox.
_STABLE_ROOT = "~/.local/share/lop"

#: Where the console scripts uv would normally write land, so the stable
#: launchers can be recognised and refreshed without a second constant.
_LOCAL_BIN = "~/.local/bin"

#: How many UNREFERENCED generations survive a prune. "Unreferenced" means no
#: live or persisted session record names it and it is not the pointer's
#: target, so this is the whole margin for a session that has a generation in
#: flight but no record yet (an engage's first ~1.2 s) and for a terminal whose
#: record has aged out. Two rather than one because the previous generation is
#: exactly the one a just-flipped fleet is still reading from.
#:
#: Bound at the top of this module from :mod:`local_operator.install_defaults`,
#: which is where the value and this rationale now live — the constant is here
#: for the readers who expect it beside the other install-layout constants, and
#: the cheap module exists so the CLI can have the int without this module's
#: ``ssl``/``urllib.request`` stack.

#: Age at which a generation with no ``.lop-source`` marker is crash debris
#: rather than an install in flight. Nothing else can leave one: every failure
#: path removes its own tree, and a finished generation always carries a marker
#: (written before its first flip) — so "no marker yet" means "uv is still
#: working in there", and only a ``kill -9`` stretches that past an hour.

    THE ONLY PROCESS PROBE THIS MODULE MAKES, and ``ps`` rather than a heavier
    reader for a measured reason: ``lsof`` walks every file descriptor the process
    holds (tens of milliseconds, and it needs the fd table) to answer what ``ps``
    already has, and ``proc_pidinfo`` is a ctypes shim over the same kernel data.
    ``psutil`` is deliberately not a dependency of this project (see
    ``tools/group_reaper.py`` for the same choice, and ``cli.py``'s ``etime``
    probe for the same sentence).

    ``text=True`` with ``errors="replace"``: argv is arbitrary bytes a process
    chose, and a decode error here must not become an exception out of a repair
    that is only decorating an upgrade which already succeeded. ``LC_ALL=C`` is
    deliberately NOT set — the precedent that sets it
    (``group_reaper._owner_start_token``) does so to pin a locale-FORMATTED date,
    and there is no format to pin in a process's own bytes.

    ``-ww`` IS NOT DECORATION, and a CI failure is what made it a required
    argument rather than a style choice (measured 2026-09-24: this PR's own
    end-to-end test read ``None`` on a Linux runner while passing here, and the
    same trap had already cost a 3.12 shard in
    ``tests/unit/secrets/test_broker_sweep.py`` — "Linux ``ps`` falls back to an
    80-column screen width and CUTS the row" whenever stdout is not a tty, which
    is every time this module calls it). The generation component lands past the
    cut — the image path alone is ~150 columns — so the row arrives with the
    generation id severed, no ancestor can match it, and this module reads that as
    "no move": silently, and exactly the case this repair exists for.
    :mod:`local_operator.procname` states the rule this now follows ("a reader that
    needs the whole line uses ``ps -ww`` or ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline``"), as does the
    environment reader in ``session/runtime/reclaim``.

    Measured in a Linux container against a live 145-column argv, to pin which
    spellings are and are not safe:

    ====================  ========================================
    ``COLUMNS``           ``ps -o args= -p <pid>`` (145-char argv)
    ====================  ========================================
    unset                 full line
    ``132``                 132 columns, generation id CUT
    ``80``                  80 columns, generation id CUT
    ``1000``              full line
    ====================  ========================================

    Add ``-ww`` ("unlimited width") and the line is complete at every one of those
    widths. macOS/BSD ``ps`` truncates only when it is writing to a TERMINAL
    (measured: identical output with and without ``COLUMNS=80`` through a pipe), so
    this repair was never wrong on the platform it runs on — but the flag is what
    makes the answer independent of the host, and the end-to-end test now pins a
    narrow ``COLUMNS`` so the hazard cannot come back.

    ``MemoryError`` is caught with the rest (review round 1, Q4, which measured one
    escaping): a host under memory pressure can fail the FORK itself, and the only
    caller that matters here is a repair inside an upgrade that has already
    succeeded — so every way of not getting an answer collapses to ``None`` rather
    than to a traceback. The blast radius without it was a spurious
    ``kind="failed"`` warning (the installer's own guard catches it), never a write
    or a reload.

    The ``subprocess`` import is function-local for this module's usual reason
    (see ``_refresh_steps``): ``update`` is imported by the TUI, and this runs once

    A PREFIX read rather than a search of the whole line, which is the measured
    shape and not a guess: the generation's own image is executed as ``argv[0]``,
    so ``ps -o args=`` prints the generation path FIRST and the command line after
    it. Measured on the operator's machine 2026-09-24 on every supervised daemon

    ``tools/local-operator/bin/Local Operator``, followed by the module and its
    arguments (the shim prefers that branded image and falls back to the same
    directory's ``python3``).

    THE PATH HAS A SPACE IN IT (``…/tools/local-operator/bin/Local Operator``),
    which is why this walks the path's ANCESTORS instead of splitting the line into
    fields: ``ps`` joins argv with single spaces and quotes nothing, so the image
    path is not separable from the argument list by parsing — and it does not have to
    be, because the generation is an ancestor of the image path, i.e. of everything
    before the first space.

    LEXICAL THE FILE, RESOLVED THE ANCESTORS, and both halves are load-bearing.
    The file itself is never resolved: the fallback interpreter in a generation's
    ``bin`` is a SYMLINK out to the uv-managed Python (``python3 -> python ->
    ~/.local/share/uv/python/…/python3.14``), so resolving it would jump OUT of the
    generation for exactly the shape in which no branded image could be planted.
    The ANCESTORS are resolved on both sides because the shim runs ``pwd -P``: on a
    machine whose home is reached through a symlink, argv carries the PHYSICAL path
    while ``generations_dir()`` is spelled from ``~``, and a lexical comparison
    would answer ``None`` for the very daemon this exists to move. Nothing is
    invented by the resolve — a PRUNED generation is absent from disk, and
    ``resolve()`` leaves those components as the path it was given.

    ``None`` for an empty or whitespace-only input, for a field that is not under

    ``launchd.rewrite_if_stale``'s, and under the generation layout it is answered
    "current" for a daemon that is generations behind, because the unit names the
    STABLE SHIM (``~/.local/share/lop/bin/python3``) and a shim does not change when
    the pointer moves. Measured live on the operator's machine 2026-09-24: four
    byte-identical plists, two daemons on the current generation and two
    two-and-three generations behind. Comparing what the RUNNING PROCESS reports is
    therefore the only question that can see the difference.

    A NONE HERE MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, and both mean "do not touch it": the
    process is running the current build, or the comparison could not be made (no
    generation in its argv, no readable pointer, a pointer that is dangling or
    being renamed as we read it). Neither is evidence of a move, so neither may
    produce one.

    NAMES ARE COMPARED RATHER THAN PATHS, because the two sides are spelled
    differently BY CONSTRUCTION: the shim's ``pwd -P`` puts the PHYSICAL path in the
    process's argv while ``current`` names whatever ``flip_pointer`` wrote, and the
    names are what a generation is. ``current`` is RESOLVED first (:func:`current_generation`
    answers with what the link NAMES, one hop), because a CHAINED pointer —
    ``current`` -> some link -> ``generations/<id>``, which no writer here produces
    but a hand-made or wrapped one can — would otherwise compare the LINK's name
    against a daemon's generation and make every daemon read as stale, four spurious
    reloads per upgrade (QA round 1, Q3). Resolving it is idempotent for the shipped
    one-hop shape.

    WHAT THIS ANSWER MEANS, stated narrowly, because the obvious reading is wrong
    (review round 1, R2): "not the generation ``current`` names" is NOT "the code
    changed". Two generations can carry the identical build — measured on this
    machine on 2026-09-24, ``generations/20260923T033831Z-71e3e49a315a`` and

    ``71e3e49a315a…`` with ``local_operator-0.62.8`` — so re-installing the same
    commit into a new generation answers "STALE" for every daemon. That is the
    repair's deliberate contract and the rejected alternative is recorded where it is
    acted on (:func:`local_operator.launchd.restart_if_build_moved`): a build-stamp

    (``lop update --from-snapshot``; the host script that pre-builds the mobile
    web bundle passes its prepared directory here).

    ``runner`` is the test seam — it receives ``(argv, env)`` because the
    environment IS the mechanism under test: ``UV_TOOL_DIR``/``UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR``
    are what keep the installer away from every other tree, so a seam that could
    only see the argv would not be watching the thing that matters.

    ORDER, and every step is load-bearing:

    1. reserve ``generations/<id>`` exclusively; uv installs into it. Nothing
       references a generation until the flip, so a tree being built is
       invisible to every reader — and reserving it with ``os.mkdir`` is what
       keeps a second install from aimng uv at the same path;
    2. write ``.lop-source`` into the new tree, so the marker is in place BEFORE
       the generation becomes visible to any reader (and so "no marker" means
       "still installing" for :func:`prune_generations`);
    3. flip ``current``;
    4. write the stable launchers and the daemon shim.

    A failure at step 1 or 2 removes the tree and raises: nothing observable has
    changed — the pointer never moved — and the caller reports the installer's
    own error. Step 4 is best-effort by design: the build is already current at
    that point, and a machine whose sandbox denies a write must not be told the
    upgrade failed. PRUNING IS THE CALLER'S, not this function's: it is a
    deletion, and every caller that wants it says so where it can report what
    went (see ``perform_upgrade``).

    NO STAGING RENAME, deliberately. Building in ``<id>.partial`` and renaming
    it into place looks tidier and is WRONG here: uv bakes the installation path
    into the console-script shims it writes under ``UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR``, so every
    one of them would name the renamed-away directory and dangle. Reserved-and-
    built-in-place keeps uv's own artefacts pointing at paths that survive.

    """The install roots named by live and persisted records, and whether all of them were read.

    FOUR NAMESPACES, because four kinds of record can name a tree a runtime is
    importing from, and a prune that reads only some of them deletes the tree
    under the runtimes only the others describe:

    * a session runtime (``run/mobile``), and
    * the ``lop serve`` daemon (``run/serve``, whose record has carried a
      ``prefix`` field all along for the update path) — the two the readers and
      the processes that publish them have to agree on, each read through its own
      registry so they cannot drift apart; and
    * the ``run/mobile/reaped`` SIDECAR — a record ``registry.scan`` has proven
      dead and MOVED there rather than deleted, because it is the evidence a
      death is classified from. It still describes a runtime that may exist: the
      scan proves the pid it names is gone, and a prune runs beside a fleet in
      which the same session may already have been re-engaged under a new pid
      from the SAME tree. Reading only the live directory made this the one
      namespace where a record could vouch for nothing.
    * the ``run/host`` BOOT records — a record published about 1.2 s before the
      first heartbeat, which is exactly the window this left unprotected (see
      ``journal.write_boot_record``): a runtime that has just started has a boot
      record and no heartbeat yet, so between those two moments the tree it is
      importing from was named by nothing here at all. That window is where a
      prune is most likely to find a "superseded, unreferenced" tree whose owner
      is in fact mid-start.

    THE TURN JOURNAL IS NOT ONE OF THE FOUR, and that is a decision rather than
    an oversight (review round 1, MINOR 1). A ``TurnJournalRow`` carries an
    ``install_root`` too, but it lives in the CONVERSATION directory rather than in
    a run namespace, and a live runtime that owns one is named by its live record
    and by its boot record as well — two independent reads would have to fail
    before the row were the only holder, and ``journal.prune_boot_records`` never
    touches a live pid's row. Reading it would mean walking every conversation under
    every config root on every prune, which is a second traversal whose own failure
    mode would then have to be answered for; the four above are the namespaces whose
    WRITERS publish a tree before anything else can name it.

    Every one of those imports is FUNCTION-LOCAL because they reach the session and
    server layers: this module is on ``lop --version``'s path and must not drag
    either in.

    AND TWO CONFIG ROOTS. ``registry.scan()`` reads ``config_dir()``, which is the
    AMBIENT one — an isolated run, a second profile, a QA pass each have their
    own — so a prune invoked under a different root could not see sessions
    published under the default one, and their generations fell back to the
    ``keep`` margin alone (review round 1, R-7). Both roots are read, deduped;
    the default (``~/.local-operator``) is the one every ordinary session on the
    machine publishes under, and reading it is what makes rule 2 mean what its
    docstring says.

    THE FAILURE DIRECTION IS THE ONE READ THIS GETS TO CHOOSE, AND IT IS NOT
    "MORE TREES" BY ACCIDENT (review round 1, MINOR 4; measured as QA round 1,
    Q2). Fewer records means FEWER protected trees and therefore MORE deletion —
    the direction that ends a running session — so a namespace that cannot be read,
    or an entry that cannot be parsed, makes this answer INCOMPLETE rather than
    empty, and an incomplete answer keeps EVERY candidate
    (``ReferencedTrees.complete``; :func:`prune_generations`). What the per-entry
    rescue in :func:`_entries_in_directory` bounds is the cost to the OTHER
    records: a torn sidecar must not be why the twenty-nine good ones beside it
    stop protecting their trees.

    removed three generations where the build before it removed none.

    EVERY HARNESS-CAUSED DEATH NAMES ITS ACTOR, and this is the call that makes the

    immediately before it does, because from that moment the runtimes inside it
    cannot record anything themselves: an install that ran over a busy fleet left

    runtimes in 13 s left no artifact naming any actor at all. A marker staged here
    turns both into attributable deaths — ``runtime-killed`` with the mechanism and
    actor on the reason — instead of a silent disappearance.

    ONLY THE RUNTIMES THE TREE ACTUALLY FEEDS are attested, by install root rather
    than by record kind: a session mid-turn, a session whose record has already been
    reaped (its runtime may still hold the tree), one that has booted but not yet
    heartbeated, and the ``serve`` daemon serving from it are all in
    :func:`_records_under`. A record with no conversation to write into — the serve
    daemon's — is skipped by ``control.note_involuntary_stop`` itself, which is why
    the returned list is the records a marker was actually written for and not the
    records that named the tree.

    ``records`` lets a caller that has already made the traversal hand it over; the
    prune does, so one removal pass costs one scan rather than one per candidate.

    THE RETURN VALUE IS ``(record, config root)`` PAIRS, not bare records, and the

    call when the act they attested does not complete).

    THE ONLY TREE THIS CAN STILL FIRE FOR is one the reader could not see, because a
    tree any record names is now kept by :func:`prune_generations` itself. The window
    that remains is real rather than theoretical: the caller takes its ``referenced``
    snapshot before the removal pass, so a runtime that publishes its boot record in
    between — the ~1.2 s a starting runtime spends with no heartbeat — is named by the
    fresh index here and by nothing in that snapshot. This is the SECOND line of

    Best-effort and never raising, for the same reason ``_remove_tree`` is: the
    caller is about to report the real error, and cleanup that raises would
    replace it. Each step is narrow on purpose:

    * the pointer is put back to whatever it named BEFORE this run (``previous``);
      "it names our generation" cannot tell whether this run created it — after
      ``flip_pointer`` that is true either way — and unlinking an already-adopted
      machine's pointer leaves ``lop`` on PATH DANGLING while the refusal claims
      the machine is as it was (review round 6, R6-1: measured, `lop` on PATH
      stopped resolving and the generation that had been current became
      unreferenced);
    * the shim is unlinked when this run found none (``remove_shim``), which is the
      only case in which it can have planted one — and the plant happens AFTER the
      step that fails, so on a fresh machine there is usually nothing there at all.
      The clause reports which of the two it was (review round 1, R1-2);
    * the copy goes through ``_remove_tree``, which reports what it could not
      remove instead of claiming it.

    ``previous`` CAN BE GONE BY THE TIME THIS RUNS, which is why the handler below
    catches ``UpdateError`` as well as ``OSError`` (review round 7, R7-1). Pruning
    is exactly the operation this layout invites while an install runs, and
    ``flip_pointer`` answers a target that has been removed with ``UpdateError``,
    not ``OSError``: catching only the latter let that escape a function whose
    contract is that it does not raise — past the shim and past the copy — so the
    pointer stayed on the refused generation WITH that generation's tree still on
    disk. That is the half-layout state D1 exists to prevent, reached by the race
    this layout makes reachable, and it was measured rather than argued.

    THE COPY IS WHERE AN UN-RESTORABLE POINTER GOES, because both consumers of
    ``current`` insist on the layout's SHAPE. ``~/.local/bin/<name>`` names
    ``<stable>/current/bin/<name>``, and the supervised shim resolves the pointer
    once and execs ``<current>/tools/local-operator/bin/python3``. That rules out
    the two obvious answers, both measured: REMOVING the pointer leaves the launcher
    with no code to run (review round 1, Q1: ``lop --version`` answered *No such file
    or directory*), and MOVING it to the install this run copied FROM aims the shim
    at a venv whose install sits at its own root, so ``<target>/tools/local-operator/
    bin/python3`` cannot exist, ``/bin/sh`` exits 126 before the shim's own legible
    ``exit 78`` can fire, and the refusal still read as if the supervised path lived
    (review round 2, R2-1/Q-R2-1). The refused COPY is the one tree here that is
    generation-shaped by construction — ``copytree`` put the legacy venv at
    ``<copy>/tools/local-operator`` and ``_link_generation_bin`` gave the root its
    own ``bin`` — so the copy is KEPT and the pointer is aimed at it. That is the
    pair ``flip_pointer`` had already made when the failure happened, which is why
    the sentence now says the copy was kept rather than claiming a clean rollback.

    WHAT DECIDES WHETHER THE COPY MUST STAY IS RESOLUTION, not authorship: whether
    anything resolves through the pointer right now (:func:`_pointer_consumers`,
    asked of the filesystem rather than of the return value of the call that wrote
    the launchers — a launcher spelled differently, or written by an older build, is
    load-bearing without being in that list; QA round 2, Q-R2-3). With nothing
    resolving through the pointer there is no consumer to keep alive, so unlinking
    it IS the pre-migration state — which is what a machine that had not adopted the

    """Delete the generations nothing can still be importing from.

    RETENTION IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A COUNT. A generation is kept when it is the
    pointer's target, when a live or persisted record names its install root, or
    when it is one of the last ``keep`` generations nothing refers to. The first
    two are the reason this is safe to run while the machine is busy: a runtime's
    own tree is never a candidate, and the count is only the margin for a session
    that has no record yet.

    EVERY REMOVAL IS ATTESTED FIRST (:func:`note_doomed_runtimes`), because this is
    the one place in the harness that deletes an install out from under runtimes
    that are importing from it: a live record can only protect a tree the reader
    COULD SEE, and the incidents where it did not — a boot record in its first
    second, a record already reaped to the sidecar — are exactly the ones that left
    no artifact naming an actor. ``actor`` is the front end's own name for the
    request (see :data:`ACTOR_PRUNE`), recorded in the marker beside the acting
    process's pid.

    Deletion is what makes the layout affordable rather than a leak — each
    generation is a whole venv — so it runs after every successful install as
    well as on demand from ``lop install prune``. Removals are returned rather
    than only logged, because both callers report them: a silent 136 MB delete is
    not something this tool gets to do. The KEEPS are returned too, with their
    reasons, for the same argument in the other direction (design review D3).

    ``.lop-source``-less generations are skipped unless they are older than
    :data:`_PARTIAL_TTL_S`, which is the only shape a ``kill -9`` mid-install
    leaves behind (every ordinary failure removes its own tree, and a finished
    generation always carries a marker). That rule is also what makes a prune
    safe to run while an install is in flight: the tree being built has no
    marker yet, so it is skipped even though nothing references it.

    THE MARGIN COUNTS MARKER-CARRYING GENERATIONS ONLY. An in-flight tree used to
    hold one of the ``keep`` places while itself being skipped by the age rule,
    so the margin protected one fewer finished generation than it promises,
    exactly while an install was running (QA round 2, Q3).

    AN UNREADABLE RECORD KEEPS THE TREE IT MIGHT NAME, and this is the one rule here
    that trades disk for certainty rather than the other way round (review round 1,
    MINOR 4; QA round 1, Q2/Q3). ``referenced`` may arrive as a
    :class:`ReferencedTrees` whose read was INCOMPLETE — an entry that would not
    parse, a namespace that could not be listed — and an incomplete read proves
    nothing by omission: the record it could not read may name any candidate, so
    every candidate is kept instead of one of them being deleted on the strength of
    a read that did not finish. The unsafe direction is not the default because it
    is not recoverable: a tree deleted while a runtime imports from it kills that
    runtime mid-turn, and the runtime's own record cannot be written afterwards —
    which is the incident this whole change set exists to end. A plain iterable of
    roots carries no such fact and is complete by construction, which is what a
    caller that resolved its own tree list is saying.

    AND AN INCOMPLETE READ IS REPORTED RATHER THAN ONLY OBEYED. The read being
    incomplete is the reason nothing is removed here, so it is carried out on the
    plan (:attr:`PrunePlan.references_complete`, with the reason it did not finish
    in :attr:`PrunePlan.references_gaps`) and printed by :func:`prune_notice_lines`
    — a prune that keeps everything must not look, on the upgrade path, like a
    prune that had nothing to do. Both readers that can discover the condition
    already log it with the file and the namespace; this is the same fact on the
    surface the operator is actually looking at.

    the installer rewrote the tree this process runs from, so the running

    process's tree — it builds a generation and flips the pointer — which makes
    ``sys.executable`` precisely the SUPERSEDED build. A repair run from it would
    render the previous build's LaunchAgent shape and report success, which is
    the failure those docstrings already call "a no-op wearing the costume of a

    (:func:`current_interpreter` — never the mutable ``current`` path, or the
    child would import through a symlink that a second upgrade can redirect
    mid-run). ``sys.executable`` stays the answer for a pip/pipx upgrade and for
    a machine that has not migrated: those installers still rewrite in place, so
    there the running interpreter genuinely is the new wheel.

    wakes supervisor kept running a plist written by whatever build installed
    them. On a machine installed before branding, that is a permanent
    ``python3.14`` row in Activity Monitor — the colleague's symptom.

    One child for all of them, because the child is the only place the NEW
    wheel's renderers exist, and because four children would pay four
    interpreter startups on every upgrade. Never raises: the upgrade already
    succeeded, so the worst outcome here is a warning.

    A PLATFORM IT CANNOT ADDRESS IS REPORTED, NOT SILENT (audit A24). The scan
    is ``~/Library/LaunchAgents``, so on Linux and Windows it finds nothing and
    this used to return an empty :class:`DaemonRefresh` — which prints nothing
    at all, and therefore reads in the upgrade summary as "there was nothing to
    do". What is true on those hosts is the opposite of reassuring: a systemd
    unit or a scheduled task written by an older build is still running the
    previous interpreter, which is exactly the drift this step exists to
    repair. Re-registering those units is a real follow-up and is deliberately
    NOT invented here — a unit/Task-XML rewrite is not the plist rewrite this
    child performs, and it needs each installer's own identity guard — so what
    ships this round is the sentence that says the refresh did not happen.

    THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS MADE *AFTER* THE SCAN, not instead of it. The scan is
    the module's own question ("which of our agents are installed") and it is
    consulted on every platform: gating the CALL on the platform made the
    function's own contract untestable off macOS, and four of this module's
    tests patch the scan and assert what the child was invoked with. What is
    platform-specific is the CONCLUSION drawn when the scan comes back empty,
    and that is where the branch belongs.

    THE SENTENCE NAMES NO DAEMON. The upgrade summary is parsed by tests that
    pin each refresh step's own output, and the mobile step must stay

    TWO QUESTIONS, and the second is the invariant this guard exists for: a

    1. **Is this an installation at all?** An editable or unknown install is
       refused outright — that is the incident this guard came from, where a
       worktree venv rewrote the operator's four live plists to point at
       itself.
    2. **Is it the SAME installation the plists already run?** A durable
       install — a uv tool, pipx — IS the interpreter ``lop`` runs from, so it
       may repair what it owns. Anything else (a hand-made venv with a PyPI
       install, a second tool env) is refused unless its prefix is the prefix
       the installed plists already record, so that such a venv cannot repoint
       the operator's daemons at itself and then be deleted.

    Prefix equality, not path equality, is the test: a stale plist recording
    ``<prefix>/bin/python3`` and the branded shape recording
    ``<prefix>/bin/Local Operator`` are the SAME install.

    The generation layout adds a THIRD recorded shape — the stable shim
    (``<stable>/bin/python3``, whose ``parent.parent`` is the stable root rather
    than a venv) — and it never reaches this comparison: only a generation
    install renders it, a generation install is a uv tool, and a uv tool answers
    ``None`` above for the reason question 2 is about (it IS the installation

    worktree points the operator's daemons at that worktree's own venv —
    reproduced exactly that way during this change's development, from a
    worktree, against the live LaunchAgents (all four were restored afterwards).
    The visible entry points cannot reach this state (an editable install is
    refused before the refresh), but the hidden flag can, and the guard belongs

    THE SAME TWO QUESTIONS :func:`_repair_refusal` ASKS before it rewrites a
    plist, because moving a daemon onto a build is the same kind of act: it
    changes which install a long-lived process runs.

    1. **Is this an installation at all?** A kind that is not a uv tool — a
       source checkout, a pip or pipx tree, anything unrecognised — is refused
       outright (serve-reload review round 2, R2-1). A worktree venv once rewrote the
       operator's four live plists to point at itself, and the same reasoning
       applies to signalling the services those plists start.
    2. **Is this process running this machine's install?** (serve-reload review rounds 3
       and 4, R3-2 then R4-1.) Asking only the first let a pip-installed `lop update` on
       a uv-tool machine reload the fleet that install owns: harmless in
       destination, since everything converges on the shared pointer, but not in
       authority, and a spurious reload cuts the app's relay for nothing.

    **THE SECOND QUESTION IS NOT "IS THIS THE POINTER'S GENERATION"**, which is
    where the first attempt at it went wrong and had to be fixed a round later.
    ``perform_upgrade`` installs into a new generation and flips the pointer **in
    this same process** — nothing re-execs, and this module says so itself where
    it explains that ``sys.executable`` is "precisely the SUPERSEDED build"
    (``_tui_reexec_hint``'s neighbourhood). So on the one path where this stage
    matters most, the caller is *by construction* the generation the pointer has
    just moved past, and comparing against the current pointer refused the very
    caller that had performed the upgrade: `lop update` would move the tree,
    refuse to move a single service, and report success. That is the reported bug
    restored one generation later.

    The question that survives both cases is membership: is this one of THIS
    MACHINE's generations? A steady-state `lop` (invoked through `current`) is;
    the superseded build a flip has just left behind is; a pip tree, a worktree
    venv or anybody else's tool directory is not. That is also the honest
    reading of what the daemons have in common — they were all started from this
    install, and they all converge on its pointer.

    ``prefix`` is a seam, not a parameter anyone passes in production: it exists
    so the upgrade-path shape above can be tested by giving this function the
    superseded prefix, which a test cannot otherwise fabricate.
