# DeepSeek native search (Anthropic-format Messages API)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# DeepSeek exposes no dedicated search endpoint: the only server-side search it
# serves is the Anthropic `web_search_20250305` server tool on the
# Anthropic-compatible Messages route. This transport mirrors the reference
# implementation in DeepSeek's own harness
# (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-search-deepseek`) so both agree on the wire shape and on
# what counts as a usable result:
#
#   * ONE auxiliary model turn per search, carrying exactly
#     "Perform a web search for the query: <query>" as its user text;
#   * `max_uses: 1` -- across 31 measured live searches DeepSeek issued exactly
#     one server-side search (`usage.server_tool_use.web_search_requests == 1`
#     every time), so a higher cap only risks paying for a second one;
#   * `max_tokens: 1024` -- observed completions were 507-1444 output tokens and
#     the sources arrive in `web_search_tool_result` blocks independently of how
#     much prose follows, so a small cap cannot lose a source;
#   * sources come from `web_search_tool_result` items only. The turn's prose is
#     a synthesized answer, NOT a source of results, so it is returned as
#     `answer` and never parsed for URLs;
#   * a response with no result block, or with no usable item, RAISES. Returning
#     the prose as a successful answer would repeat the anonymity-wall defect the
#     Perplexity transport has, where a non-empty string stops the fallback chain
#     with nothing the model can act on.
#
# Two measured limitations belong here rather than in a ticket:
#
#   * `web_search_result` items carry `page_age` in the schema but it arrived
#     EMPTY on all 310 items observed, and text blocks carried no `citations`
#     array at all (thinking and non-thinking alike), so DeepSeek's own harness
#     note holds: "Uncited results carry no `snippet`". Sources are therefore
#     title+URL on this path, weaker than DuckDuckGo/Tavily/Brave, and the
#     synthesized `answer` is the only descriptive text the model gets.
#   * Cost is a full model turn: median 14.5k input + 0.9k output tokens per
#     search (cached page content dominates the input side), i.e. ~$0.0024
#     off-peak / ~$0.0048 peak at deepseek-flash list price (2026-09). That is
#     more than the free transports and than Tavily's monthly plans, so this
#     provider is credential-gated and belongs in an `ordered` chain behind the
#     free paths rather than in the default rotation.

# snippet: measured, `page_age` is always empty and text blocks carry no
# `citations`), so the model gets nothing to judge WHICH page is worth fetching.
# The page text is nevertheless reachable: returning the assistant's content
# blocks verbatim in a follow-up Messages request restores them in the model's
# context -- DeepSeek honours Anthropic's `encrypted_content` contract, and the
# restored pages arrive as CACHE READS (input_tokens ~200, cache_read 9-19k), so
# re-asking about them is cheap. A third turn can keep asking about the same
# pages with no new search billed.

# Measured over three queries, replay + triage of the top 5:
#   * 4.1-7.4s added, $0.0013-0.0021 peak on top of the search turn;
#   * 5/5 rows returned a url, summary and verbatim quote, 0 malformed lines;
#   * quotes verified verbatim against the live pages in 4/5-5/5 cases.
# Asking for all 10 sources in one turn instead truncates at any sane
# `max_tokens` (measured: JSONL overran 3072 tokens, malformed rows, and the
# quotes degraded), and asking the SAME turn to emit the evidence was slower
# (9.1-13.0s) and 2-3x the cost of search-then-triage -- which is why the
