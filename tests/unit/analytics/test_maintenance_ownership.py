"""One owner for host-wide analytics maintenance, and a bounded WAL.

Two defects this file pins, both measured on the operator's live host:

* **18-22 processes each ran their own hourly retention sweep.**
  ``AnalyticsRecorder._last_prune`` is a per-PROCESS attribute, so every process
  holding ``analytics.db`` swept the same ledger on its own timer. A steady-state
  prune is cheap (0.7 ms of CPU) and an idempotent one is not wrong, but a sweep
  that finds a backlog is not cheap (892.8 ms of CPU for a 400k-row delete) and
  each one wrote a WAL as large as the database.
* **The WAL was 528,204,632 bytes and did not move** across samples 20 s apart —
  128,956 pages, 129x SQLite's 1000-page auto-checkpoint threshold — because
  nothing in the tree ever truncated it.

The tests below are structural wherever the property IS a structure (which lock
file was created, whether ``prune`` ran, on which thread, in which order), and
they wait on events rather than on the clock. The one timing bound is called out
where it appears, with the measurement that gives it its margin.

THE ELECTION, in one paragraph, because every test here is about one part of it:
the recorder whose hourly timer fires takes ``<root>/run/analytics-maintenance.lock``
with ``LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB`` (never waiting), reads the wall-clock stamp in that
file, and sweeps only if the stamp is missing or older than an hour; it stamps
the file after the sweep returns. The lock makes the read-modify-write atomic;
the stamp is what makes ownership survive the winner's exit, so a process whose
timer fires ten minutes later does not sweep the same hour again.

    The reader takes its snapshot BEFORE the frames are written, which is the
    only way to pin a backfill (a reader that arrives afterwards pins nothing and
    the checkpoint simply succeeds). The WAL is byte-for-byte unchanged by the
    refused sweep, and the sweep after the reader goes away reclaims it — so the
    maintenance is deferred, never lost.

    THE ONE TIMING BOUND, and why it is wall time: the regression it guards is a
    wait inside the busy handler, which is sleeping, not computing — CPU time
    would not see it at all. The healthy path does no I/O here (every frame is
    pinned, so the passive pass backfills nothing) and returns in microseconds;
    the regressed shape is the measured 5.18 s, so 2.0 s sits between them with
    room for a loaded runner. The structural guard for the same hazard is
