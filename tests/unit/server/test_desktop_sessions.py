# pool-wide lock across its WHOLE body, so one conversation's lookup (a
# whole-journal parse before this change) and its socket attach were every other
# conversation's wait.
#
# Every test here is STRUCTURAL: each asserts what COMPLETED, never how long it
# took, because a wall-clock bound on a box at load average ~200 measures the
# weather (AGENTS.md §Timing). Each carries ONE deadline, and it is a backstop
# rather than the assertion — the pass condition is the state the deadline
# wraps — so a regression fails the suite instead of hanging it. On the
# pre-change code every one of these hangs at that backstop.

#: Backstop for an open that must complete while another session is parked. Not a
#: latency budget: 30 s is ~1000x what the same open costs on an idle box.
