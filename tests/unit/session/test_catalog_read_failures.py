"""A read that failed must not be published as a reading.

Three defects, one theme, and every test here is a shape of the same mistake:
an ``OSError``-shaped failure on the catalogue path answering a question the
code was never in a position to answer.

* **An unreadable store reported as an empty one.** ``_scan_sessions`` put only
  the ``os.scandir`` CONSTRUCTOR inside its ``try`` and answered ``[]`` for any
  ``OSError`` — ``EMFILE`` under descriptor exhaustion, ``EACCES``, ``EIO`` —
  so the desktop list route answered ``200 {"sessions": []}`` and the sidebar,
  which adopts that answer as MEMBERSHIP, wiped its visible catalogue. A store
  that is simply NOT THERE is the one case that really is empty, and the tests
  below pin that boundary from both sides.
* **A mid-scan failure escaping as a bare 500.** The iterator was unguarded, so
  a directory that grew or rotated under the poll produced a half-built listing
  (or a bare ``OSError`` no route handler maps) instead of the same surfaced
  unavailability as a failed open.
* **A swallowed degradation published as a confident negative.** ``decorate_rows``
  swallowed the live-record scan, the wake index and the attention read, leaving
  the rows' defaults in place — and a defaulted ``live_state=""`` is
  indistinguishable from a measured "this session is cold", so the wire said
  ``active: false`` about a store with a running turn in it and the sidebar
  rendered "Nothing running right now" over it.

The renderer half of the fix lives in the UI repository; what is pinned here is
what the WIRE says, which is all this repository owns.
