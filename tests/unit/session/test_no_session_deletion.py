"""No code outside ``session/cleanup.py`` may remove, rename or replace a
session directory — enforced over the source tree, by AST, naming file:line.

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. An automatic "unused session" reaper (#576) and an
exit-path ``rmdir`` (#622) both shipped as "safe" and both fired on the
operator's real store; every surviving session directory afterwards had a
birth time hours after its transcript's first row, so directories were also
being recreated — a rename or replace of a session directory is a deletion
of the original by another name. Reading the module docstring that promised
"nothing is ever deleted" did not stop either. A test that fails the build
on the *shape* of the code does.

HOW IT WORKS. Every ``.py`` under ``local_operator/`` is parsed and each call
named in :data:`_NAMES` is checked against :data:`_ALLOWED`, an explicit
allow-list keyed by ``relative/path.py::function::call-label`` — the
FUNCTION and the SPECIFIC CALL SHAPE in it (``os.replace``, ``<path>.unlink``,
``shutil.rmtree``…) — carrying the reason that call cannot reach a session
directory. Keyed by call, not by function, because an excused function is
otherwise a blind surface: review round 2 (R2-1) dropped ``shutil.rmtree``
into an allow-listed ``wakes/store.py::remove_entry`` and the function-keyed
list waved it through. Anything not in the list fails with its
``file:line``. Adding a call site therefore means adding a row HERE with a
reason a reviewer can check — the point is not that the list is short, it
is that every entry was argued for.

BIASED TOWARD FALSE POSITIVES, on purpose. Import aliases are resolved
(``from shutil import rmtree``, ``import shutil as sh``), a call on ANY
receiver counts (``target.rmdir()``, ``Path(...).unlink()``, ``self.path.
rename(x)``), and ``unlink``/``remove`` are in the set because a transcript is
a file. The only exclusions are shapes that are provably not the filesystem:
``.replace(a, b)`` with two positionals is ``str.replace``; ``.remove(x)`` on a
literal container. A ``widget.remove()`` or ``listeners.remove(cb)`` therefore
lands in the allow-list with a one-word reason — that cost is the point, and
review round 1 measured what the cheaper guard missed (R1-2: 5 of 8 mutants).
Two tests at the bottom pin the mutants and the exclusions.
