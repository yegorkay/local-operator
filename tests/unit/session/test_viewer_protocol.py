"""Every session member the TUI reaches must be DECLARED on a protocol.

The bug this closes has a shape, and the shape has repeated. The front end
talks to its session through ``getattr(session, "name", None)`` duck-probes
against attributes that no protocol declares. A probe string is data, so:

* a rename on the facade leaves every probe reading ``None`` — pyright sees
  nothing, and the capability silently disappears rather than failing;
* a typo in the string is undetectable for the same reason;
* the graceful fallback the probe already has ("older owner, no such member")
  absorbs the failure and reports a plausible wrong answer instead of raising.

That is not hypothetical. ``/info`` reported zero subagents for a session that
had several because ``subagent_comms`` was private on the facade and the probe
returned ``None`` (see ``AttachedSession.subagent_comms``), and the
``is_remote``-conflation half of the same problem has been fixed site-locally
four times (#576, #609, #624, #625) with a fifth guarded in
``tests/unit/tui/test_noop_consumers.py``.

Site-local fixes do not close a class of bug. This does: it derives the member
set from the SOURCE — the session-valued attribute accesses and literal-string
duck-probes in the files listed in ``_SCANNED`` — and fails when one of them is
not declared on a protocol: ``SessionProtocol``, ``ViewerSessionProtocol``, or
the owner-side ``GoalRecordProtocol`` (which exists because the judged-goal
record is the SESSION OWNER's surface and the shared protocol must not promise a
follower the right to settle somebody else's goal; see its docstring). Adding a
new undeclared duck-typed member therefore fails here rather than in a user's
terminal.

The derivation is deliberately syntactic rather than type-inferred: pyright
cannot follow ``getattr`` with a literal string, which is precisely why these
members escaped typing in the first place.

**What the derivation reaches, stated precisely — it is not "every access".**
It sees ``<expr>.member`` and a two-or-more-argument call to any name in
``_PROBE_CALLS`` (``getattr``, ``hasattr``, and ``info/collect.py``'s ``_attr``
wrapper) whose member name is any of:

* a literal string;
* a name bound by a ``for probe in ("a", "b")`` loop, INCLUDING a tuple-unpack
target (``for probe, default in (("a", None),)``), which is read
positionally off the literal rows;
* a module-level string constant OR a local one bound to the same literal shape
in the scope that reads it;

where ``<expr>`` is one of the bindings registered for that file in ``_SCANNED``
or a single-level local ALIAS of one (``session = source.session``). An alias is
followed only while it is LIVE — from the binding that makes it a session to the
next binding of the same name in the same scope — which is what stops a
same-scope reuse (``previous = source.session`` … ``previous = rows[-1]``) from
attributing the row's members to a session. It is blind to:

* an alias chased through a second hop (``a = self._session; b = a``);
* an alias read from a scope other than the one that binds it;
* any other attribute or helper return holding a session
  (``self._current_session().member``);
* a probe name computed at runtime by none of the literal routes above — a dict
  lookup, a list built incrementally, an f-string. ``_session_is_busy`` was the
  canonical instance of the SHAPE this now covers: it looped
  ``for probe in ("is_busy", "busy")``, neither name exists on either class, so
  it returned a hard-coded ``False`` and its ``/loop stop`` caller took a dead
  branch. That loop is now recognized — and was removed rather than declared
  around — with ``test_the_guard_sees_a_loop_computed_probe_name`` proving the
  loop shape still fails here if it comes back;
* sessions arriving as differently-named parameters;
* files outside ``_SCANNED``.

A green run means "no *reachable-by-this-derivation* probe is undeclared", not
"the front end is fully typed". Widening any of the above is a matter of adding
an expression or a path — the machinery does not change. What is NOT a way to
widen it: an exclusion set. There is none for undeclared members any more (see
the note where one used to live), so a new member reached by any of the routes
above fails with its name and ``file:line``.

**Do not narrow pyright's path to ``local_operator/``.** Half of the
conformance claim is not in ``session/`` at all: it is carried by
``_static_conformance_is_checked_by_pyright`` at the bottom of THIS file, whose
body is the only place the two classes are assigned to the protocol types. A
viewer member broken with no internal caller gives ``pyright
local_operator/session/`` zero errors, and only checking this file reports it
(QA round 1). Excluding ``tests/`` from pyright, or pointing it at the package
alone, therefore disarms the static half silently and leaves the suite green.

#:

#:
#: ``self.app.session`` is NOT here, and its removal is a fix rather than a
#: narrowing: it was registered while occurring nowhere in the package, so it
#: implied coverage of a spelling that does not exist. A binding that matches
#: nothing is worse than an absent one — it reads as watched. Every entry here
#: is now asserted to derive at least one member by
#: ``test_every_registered_session_binding_still_matches_the_source`` (QA round
#: 2, Q5), which is what makes that claim checkable instead of aspirational.
#:
#: These are the ROOT bindings, matched literally. A single-level local alias

#: followed, but only while it is LIVE: inside the scope that binds it, from the
#: statement that binds it to the next statement in that scope that rebinds the
#: same name to something else. Both halves of that boundary are load-bearing.
#: Resolving assignments ACROSS scopes is where the false positives that nearly
#: killed this probe come from, and so is treating a name as an alias for the
#: rest of the scope after it has been reused for a row or a widget — the same
#: ``previous``/``current``/``remote`` reuse, one binding later. See
#: ``_scope_bindings`` and ``_alias_live_at`` for the liveness rule. This list
#: stays the thing to extend when a new root binding appears; a new alias needs

#: The binding that holds a session in the TUI's interaction helper.
#:
#: ``self.session`` was registered against ``app.py``, where it derives nothing
#: — the app spells it ``self._session``. Rather than drop the spelling (which
#: stops watching a name that IS live elsewhere), it is pointed at the file that
#: actually uses it. Scanning that file adds no undeclared members today, so the
#: entry costs a parse and buys a real binding instead of a fictional one.
_INTERACTION_SESSION_EXPRS = frozenset({"self.session"})

#: The bindings that hold a viewer facade in the desktop host.
#:
#: Separate from ``_SESSION_EXPRS`` because the name differs by host: the
#: bridge stores its facade as ``self.remote`` and copies it into a local
#: ``remote`` before use, which is a session binding by the same reasoning
#: ``self._session`` is one in the TUI.
_HOST_SESSION_EXPRS = frozenset({"remote", "self.remote"})

#: The bindings that hold a viewer facade in a desktop ROUTE module.
#:
#: A third spelling, and it had to be added rather than folded into the set
#: above: the routes reach the facade through the bridge they are handed by the
#: ``host(request).session(...)`` context manager, so the binding is
#: ``bridge.remote`` (and ``child.remote`` for the fork route's child), while
#: ``desktop_catalogues.py`` also copies it into a local ``remote`` exactly as
#: the utils host does.
#:
#: This is the binding QA round 2 (Q4) found the guard could not read, and the
#: three members behind it — ``bind_runtime``, ``admit_prompt``, ``answer_gate``
#: — are the more severe shape of the escape: HARD accesses in live HTTP
#: routes, so a rename is a 500 on the phone portal rather than a silent
#: ``None``. Adding this set needed no new machinery, only another literal
#: binding, which is why it is fixed here rather than deferred.
#:
#: Split PER ROUTE HOST rather than shared, for the reason
#: ``_INTERACTION_SESSION_EXPRS`` is separate from ``_SESSION_EXPRS``: a binding
#: registered against a file that does not use it is a coverage claim the file
#: cannot honour. All three spellings against all three route hosts produced
#: four (host, binding) pairs deriving nothing, and a shared set hid every one
#: of them behind a sibling host that did use the name — which is exactly the

#: TUI-specific spellings (``self._session``, ``source.session``) which do not
#: occur here, and re-using it would imply a coverage claim this file cannot
#: make. Verified equivalent on today's source — scanning ``collect.py`` with

#: rather than merely cheaper.
_INFO_SESSION_EXPRS = frozenset({"session"})

#: Files scanned for session duck-probes, with the bindings to read in each.
#:
#: Not just the TUI. ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` lives in ``session/`` rather
#: than in ``tui/`` precisely because the viewer facade has more than one
#: consumer, and the desktop host is the other one: it duck-probed
#: ``supports_completion_ack`` (``desktop_sessions.py:223``/``262``) — on
#: ``AttachedSession``, absent from ``Session``, declared on neither protocol —
#: which is exactly the escape this guard exists to close, one file outside
#: its original scope. A rename there made the phone portal report
#: completion-attention as unsupported, silently and with no error.
#:
#: ``info/collect.py`` is here because it is the host of the MOTIVATING bug —
#: the ``/info`` screen that reported zero subagents — and round 2 found the
#: guard did not observe it. The reviewer renamed ``AttachedSession.
#: subagent_comms``, i.e. re-shipped that exact regression, and got a green
#: guard and zero pyright errors; only a site-local test in
#: ``tests/unit/info/`` objected, which is precisely the kind of coverage this
#: file's docstring argues does not close a class of bug (review round 2,
#: MAJOR-1). A guard that misses the defect it was built from is not a guard.
#:
#: The desktop ROUTE modules are here for the same reason one file below them
#: is: they hold the same facade under a different binding. Only these three of
#: the five ``desktop_*`` route modules touch a session at all
#: (``desktop_profiles.py`` and ``desktop_radient.py`` derive zero members), so
#: listing those two would buy scan cost and no coverage.
#:
#: Adding a host is one entry here plus whatever it turns out to be probing.
#: Other ``tui/`` modules also probe sessions (``session_interaction.py``,
#: ``widgets/session_panel.py``, ``widgets/todo_panel.py``,
#: ``widgets/subagent_panel.py``, ``widgets/wake_panel.py``), but every member
#: they read is already declared or excluded below, so listing them today buys
#: scan cost and no coverage; add one when it starts probing something new.
#:
#: The third element is that host's MINIMUM member count, and it is per host for
#: a structural reason: ``app.py`` derives 105 of the 113 DISTINCT PUBLIC
#: MEMBERS (and 363 of 414 ``file:line`` SITES, deduped per member and line), so
#: any single global floor loose enough to survive ordinary churn there cannot
#: notice a smaller host going dark at all. Measured, not guessed: dropping the
#: desktop utils host costs 3 VIEWER-ONLY MEMBERS out of 48 and dropping
#: ``info/collect.py`` costs 0, so both slid under a global ``>= 40`` — the exact
#: slack review round 2 (MINOR-1) raised, reproduced one floor higher. A count
#: stated beside each path fires on the host that actually decayed and names it.
#:
#: Every figure above names the quantity it counts, because two of them were
#: wrong when this argument was first made — "104 of the 139 sites" crossed a
#: member count with a site count, and the viewer-only total was off by one
#: (review round 3, MINOR-6 / QA round 3, Q9). The dominance claim is now
#: ASSERTED, as a RATIO, in
#: ``test_app_py_dominates_the_derivation_so_a_global_floor_cannot_work``; the
#: absolute counts here are a snapshot for the reader and will drift with
#: ordinary work, which is exactly why the test does not pin them.
#:
#: Set a few members below the current value: enough headroom that deleting a
#: call site is not a test failure, tight enough that losing a BINDING or a PATH
#: is. Removing a probe legitimately means lowering the number in the same
#: commit, which is where the argument for it belongs.

#:
#: ``getattr``/``hasattr`` are the builtins. ``_attr`` is ``info/collect.py``'s
#: own wrapper (``_attr(session, "name", default)``): it exists because the
#: members it reads are PROPERTIES on the real ``Session`` and a property on an
#: unhealthy session can raise, which a bare ``getattr`` would let escape a

#:
#: It has to be listed because a wrapper is indistinguishable from any other

#: derived nothing from the three lines that matter — the guard would have been
#: widened to the motivating host and still not observed it (review round 2,

#: There is deliberately NO "undeclared member" exclusion set any more.

#: ``wake_scheduler``, ``mcp_manager``, ``pending_gate``, ``epoch``, the
#: attention pair, …), each reached by a duck-probe the guard could see and
#: pyright could not. ``_KNOWN_MISSING_ON_BOTH_CLASSES`` held one name, ``cwd``,
#: probed by ``app.py`` but present on NEITHER class, so the saved preview's
#: working directory was ALWAYS ``""``. Both are closed: the 18 are declared on
#: ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` — the protocol every host that reads them holds,
#: and the one whose conformance the doubles already satisfy — and the ``cwd``
#: read goes through the declared ``frontend_state`` accessor. The contract is
#: TOTAL, so there is nothing left to exclude.
#:
#: Reinstating a name here would re-open the exact class of defect this file
#: exists to close: an undeclared member whose ``getattr`` default reports a
#: plausible wrong answer while pyright stays silent. A new undeclared member
#: is therefore a FAILURE naming the member and its ``file:line`` — never a
#: mute list. If a member is genuinely engine-internal, the fix is to move the
#: host read onto the concrete type or an already-declared accessor, exactly as
#: ``cwd`` was moved, and to say why in the comment beside that read.
#:
#: ``subagent_comms`` is worth naming because it was this file's MOTIVATING
#: member. It is read by ``/info``, it lives on both classes, and until
#: ``info/collect.py`` joined ``_SCANNED`` the reviewer could re-ship the
#: original fabricated zero-subagent outage with a green guard and zero pyright
#: errors (review round 2, MAJOR-1). Declaring it is what turns a rename to a
#: name that exists on neither class into a failure HERE rather than in a
#: user's terminal.

#: Names that MUST NOT come back — neither read by a host nor defined on a class.
#:
#: This set changed meaning in Stage 3 and the inversion is the point. While
#: ``is_remote`` still existed it was an EXCLUSION: the guard skipped it so the
#: flag's own call sites did not read as undeclared members. The flag is now
#: deleted, so the same name in the same set now means the opposite — reading it
#: or defining it is a FAILURE, enforced by
#: ``test_a_retired_session_flag_cannot_be_reintroduced`` below.
#:
#: Why a set rather than one assertion about one name. The defect is a SHAPE,
#: not a spelling: an undeclared boolean on one session class, duck-probed
#: through ``getattr(session, "...", False)`` at every call site, whose default
#: silently means the common case. That shape was fixed site-locally five times
#: (#576, #609, #624, #625, and the ``_cmd_model`` guard) before anyone removed
#: the flag, because each fix addressed a call site and none addressed the
#: attribute. A named set is what makes "this axis is closed" checkable instead
#: of remembered — the next agent who reaches for a transport boolean adds a
#: line here to argue for it, rather than reintroducing it silently.
#:
#: Three things are asserted for every name, because catching only one of them
#: leaves the other two routes open: it is absent from BOTH classes (so it
#: cannot be re-added to ``AttachedSession`` and duck-probed), absent from BOTH
#: protocols (so it cannot be laundered by declaring it), and read by NO scanned
#: host (so a probe against a name that exists nowhere cannot sit there
#: returning its default forever — the ``cwd`` defect, closed by rewriting that
#: read against a declared accessor.

    """Assert the dominance the per-host floor's justification rests on.

    ``_SCANNED`` argues for a floor PER HOST rather than one global number, and
    the argument is entirely quantitative: ``app.py`` derives so much of the
    total that any global floor loose enough to survive churn there sits above
    every other host's whole contribution. If that ratio ever stops holding, the
    per-host design is over-engineering and the comment defending it is wrong.

    Asserted rather than left in prose because two of these numbers WERE wrong
    (review round 3, MINOR-6 / QA round 3, Q9): the text said "104 of the 139
    sites", conflating distinct members with ``file:line`` site strings, and
    said 49 viewer-only members where there are 48. Two independent reviewers
    measured two different pairs of numbers from the same tree, which is what a
    figure nothing executes looks like from outside. Everything this file
    asserts about the source is derived; the argument for its own shape should
    not be the one exception.

    Each number states exactly WHICH QUANTITY it counts, because that ambiguity
    is what produced the wrong figure and then hid it. Two reviewers measuring
    this tree independently reported 104/112 members with 362/413 sites and
    104/124 members with 364/415 sites, and BOTH were arithmetically right — the
    three axes they silently differed on are:

    * PUBLIC vs ALL members. Underscore-prefixed names are excluded here (112),
      included there (124). ``_session_members_touched`` collects both; every
      assertion in this file that consumes it filters, so public is the number
      that matches what is guarded.
    * DISTINCT MEMBERS vs SITE STRINGS. A member touched in twelve places is one
      member and twelve sites. The original prose said "104 of the 139 sites"
      while 104 is a MEMBER count — the two axes crossed in a single sentence.
    * RAW occurrences (364/415) vs sites DEDUPED by ``(member, line)``
      (362/413). ``_all_touched`` dedupes, so two probes of the same member on
      one line collapse; ``session.history`` on ``app.py`` lines 19279 and 19356
      is the only such pair today, and it is the whole 2-site gap.

    The RATIO is asserted rather than the absolute counts, and that is the point
    rather than a weakening. The counts churn on ordinary work — over the last
    30 commits touching ``app.py`` the site total moved eight times and the
    member total four, none of them a decay — so pinning them exactly would fire
    on unrelated PRs and train the next author to bump a number without reading
    what it claims. AGENTS.md ("Prefer a structural invariant to a numeric one")
    is the standing guidance. Dominance is the fact the per-host design rests
    on, it is what a global floor cannot accommodate, and it is stable: measured
    at 0.925-0.929 across that same history, against a bound of 0.80.

    # to catch rather than ordinary churn.
    #
    # 50 → 49 is a DELIBERATE removal, not decay: ``credential_op`` moved from
    # ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` to ``SessionProtocol`` (the capability is a
    # session capability — execute locally or route — not a viewer one), so it
    # left the viewer-only population by becoming declared for both shapes.
    # That move is the fix for the inline ``/credential`` half-feature; a
    # LATER drop back to this figure would mean the word crept home again.
    #
    # 49 → 47 is the same shape of move, twice over: the live-tool-row resume
    # work needs the pending/executing display ids on a LOCAL session too, so
    # ``pending_display_tool_ids`` and ``executing_display_tool_ids`` moved
    # onto ``SessionProtocol`` and both left the viewer-only population by
    # becoming declared for both shapes.
    #
    # 47 → 48 is an ADDITION, and the first move in this list in that direction.
    # ``set_steer_failure`` is a viewer-only member by construction: only a
    # viewer sends a steer across a socket, so only a viewer can have one fail
    # without a sender to report it (QA round 2, Q-1). An `owner` `Session` has
    # no such seam and must not grow one; a later figure that counts it as
    # declared-for-both would mean the in-process session had grown a transport
    # failure it cannot have.
    #
    # 48 → 50 is the same direction again: the desktop warm op adds
    # ``warm_runtime`` and ``engage_in_flight``, both viewer-only for the same
    # kind of reason — a runtime has no viewer to warm speculatively and no
    # bind lock to sample — and both are read by the desktop bridge through
    # ``bridge.remote``. Growth is not the decay this pin guards against (the
    # aggregate below is a FLOOR), but the figure is exact on purpose, so it
    # is edited deliberately rather than relaxed.
    #
    # 50 → 51 is the same direction once more. ``can_ever_bind`` asks whether a
    # facade could EVER dial, which is a question only a facade needs to answer:
    # the sidebar's connect spends a wall-clock budget re-dialling one, and the
    # arm that can never dial must be told apart from the one that is on its way
    # back. An owner ``Session`` binds by running the loop in this process, so
    # it has no un-bindable state to report and must not grow a predicate for
    # one.
    #
    # 51 → 52 is the same direction again, and for the sibling question:
    # ``session_was_stopped`` tells a host that never saw the disconnect whether
    # the owner was STOPPED (a durable marker, plus this viewer's own stop) —
    # which is what decides whether re-dialling a clicked row is worth anything.
    # An owner ``Session`` is the thing that ends, so there is no record to read
    # back about itself and no un-bindable state to classify.
    #
    # 52 → 53 is the same reasoning once more: the lease-driven warm's retry
    # loop needs ``recovering`` to tell a REFUSED engage (recovery owns the
    # dial, no work done, no spawn to pace) from a FAILED one, and only a viewer
    # can be in owner recovery at all — an owner `Session` has no lost owner to
    # recover from, so the member is viewer-only by construction rather than by
    # placement.
    #
    # 53 → 54 is the same direction again: the desktop move route needs the
    # directory the session WORKS in — to resolve a relative target against it
    # (``/move ../sibling``) and to recognise a no-op — and that is a viewer's
    # field. An owner ``Session`` cannot usefully answer it: its directory is the
    # one its process was constructed in and no seam moves it, so there is
    # nothing for an owner to report back about where it works.
    #
    # 54 → 56 is the same direction twice more, from the move remediation.
    # ``supports_exclusive_move`` is asked of the OWNER ABOVE this facade —
    # whether it can retire under the exclusivity fence rather than ignoring the
    # flag while a sibling client is attached — and an owner ``Session`` has no
    # owner above it, so the question does not exist for it at all.
    # ``set_local_cwd_callback`` installs the host that repaints after a locally
    # accepted move (the desktop bridge's ``frontend.replace``); an owner session
    # has no host above it to repaint, so it must not grow that callback either.
    # Both are ADDITIONS in the direction the aggregate floor does not guard, and
    # the figure is exact on purpose — edited deliberately, never relaxed.
    #
    # 56 → 57 is the drain notice's own seam: the app paints the row that says a
    # handover is REFUSING work from the runtime's ``retiring`` frame, so it
    # reads ``set_drain_callback`` off a duck-typed binding. Viewer-only for the
    # same reason as the rest of this block — an owner session has no wire to
    # hear that frame on, and the frame is the only honest source for the fact.
    #
    # 57 → 58 is the desktop Stop button's rung. ``interrupt`` stops the current
    # turn and returns the owner's receipt, which only exists on the viewer side:
    # an owner ``Session`` stops its own turn with a local call and has nobody to
    # dial, so the member is viewer-only by construction rather than by choice.
    # Its declared home is ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` (the same commit), which is
    # why the undeclared-member check above does not fire for it — the two
    # figures answer different questions and this one counts the facade's extra
    # surface either way.
    #
    # 58 → 59 is the same rung's second read. ``owner_reachable`` is the "is there
    # a LIVE owner to dial" half of ``is_cold``, split out because that property's
    # third disjunct is a mid-resync state: an owner ``Session`` has no client at
    # all, so the question does not exist for it.
    #
    # 61 → 62 is the refused-gate-reply channel (issue #1310). It is viewer-only
    # for the same reason ``set_drain_callback`` is: an owner ``Session`` answers
    # its own gates, so nobody above it can refuse an answer and the hook has no
    # meaning there. It arrived DECLARED (``ViewerSessionProtocol``, the same
    # commit) — this counter still moves, because it counts the facade's extra
    # surface either way, and its home is recorded here so the next reader does
    # not have to re-derive why.
    #
    # 62 → 63 is the operator-prompt notice (issue #1310, round 6, UX U3). Also
    # viewer-only, and for the strongest version of the same reason: the sentence
    # describes a presence prompt THIS machine's key is about to raise, so the
    # surface it belongs on is an attached pane with a human standing at it. An
    # owner ``Session`` runs the loop where the prompt is raised and has no host
    # above it to paint on. Declared in ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` in the same
    # commit, which is what this file's first assertion required.
    #
    # 59 → 61 is the read-without-an-owner rung, and it moves by TWO because the
    # pair answers two different questions a cold read now reports separately:
    # ``cold_reason`` is WHY (no pid holds the lease, one does and stayed silent,
    # or it is finishing work in flight) and ``attaching`` is that an
    # authenticated dial is retained and its state has not arrived. Both are on
    # the wire, both are read off a duck-typed bound facade by the bridge, and
    # neither exists for an owner ``Session`` — it has no dial to be silent on.
    #
    # 63 → 64 is the paint-first attach flag (PR #1474, UX round 1, U1).
    # ``attach_behind`` marks a cold viewer opened IN FRONT of a live owner it
    # binds to behind the paint, which is what the TUI narrates and bounds. An
    # owner ``Session`` has no owner to attach to, so the flag has no meaning
    # there. Declared in ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` in the same commit.
    #
    # 64 → 65 is the undelivered-reply hook (PR #1315, UX round 1, U1).
    # ``set_gate_undelivered_handler`` reports an answer that was accepted at this
    # pane and never reached the owner — a distinction only a facade has, because
    # an owner ``Session`` answers its own gates with no wire to cross. Declared
    # in ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` in the same commit.
    #
    # 65 → 66 is the canonical collection revision (the TUI roster-coalescing
    # change). ``frontend_revision`` lets the dock band and todo panel skip a
    # re-derivation nothing moved under; an owner ``Session`` publishes through
    # its own store and has no follower copy to diff. Declared in
    # ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` in the same commit.
    #
    # 66 → 67 is the desktop withdrawal (round 3, the transport-bound hole).
    # ``withdraw_desktop_watch`` is the viewer's explicit end-of-attachment
    # signal — the one frame that clears the runtime's session-scoped attach
    # memory rather than renewing it. An owner ``Session`` serves its own pane
    # in-process, so it holds no attach lease of its own to withdraw. Declared
    # in ``ViewerSessionProtocol`` in the same commit.

    The anti-regression half of Stage 3, and the reason the deletion is worth
    more than the seventeen substitutions that preceded it. ``is_remote`` was
    fixed site-locally FIVE times over four PRs (#576, #609, #624, #625, plus
    the ``_cmd_model`` guard in ``tests/unit/tui/test_noop_consumers.py``) and

    So this asserts the axis is closed rather than that one call site is
    correct, and it closes all three routes back in. Any one left open makes the
    other two decorative:

    * **On a class.** ``AttachedSession.is_remote = True`` reappearing is enough
      on its own — every historical read was ``getattr(session, "...", False)``

    * **On a protocol.** Declaring it would satisfy
      ``test_every_session_member_a_host_touches_is_declared`` and make the
      probes legitimate, which is the laundering route that test's ``known``
      union no longer offers.
    * **In a host.** A probe against a name that exists nowhere does not raise:
      it returns the ``False`` default forever, silently — the shape of the
      ``cwd`` defect this file now closes by rewriting that read against a
      declared accessor, and of ``_session_is_busy``'s ``is_busy``/``busy``.

    Protocol checks member PRESENCE only, so a facade whose

    The floor in ``test_the_viewer_protocol_covers_what_only_the_facade_has``
    catches decay in AGGREGATE, and QA round 2 (Q5) showed that is not enough:
    renaming ``self._session`` in ``_SESSION_EXPRS`` drops five members and the
    total stays above any floor loose enough to be maintainable. A per-pair
    assertion catches the same decay at its source and names the host and the
    binding, which a total never can.

    Zero sites means one of two things and both need the reader's attention: the
    binding was renamed in the source (fix the set), or it never matched and the
    coverage it implies was always fictional. ``self.session`` and
    ``self.app.session`` were the second case — registered in ``_SESSION_EXPRS``
    and matching nothing in ``app.py`` — so they are asserted against the files
    that DO use them rather than being quietly dropped, since dropping a
    binding is how a real spelling stops being watched.

    The count is pinned as well as the contribution, because the two decays are
    different and only one of them is a rename. DELETING ``source.session``
    outright costs 2 of 48 viewer-only members — under any floor, per-host or
    aggregate, and invisible to the zero-sites check because a removed entry is
    not an entry that derives nothing. It was the last planted violation this
    guard did not catch. A registered binding is a coverage claim, so removing
    one has to be a deliberate edit to a stated number rather than a quiet
    deletion.

    Counted per (HOST, BINDING) rather than over the union across hosts, which
    round 3 found was hiding two distinct failures at once (review MAJOR-3, QA
    Q7). A union credits a binding as live as long as ANY scanned host uses it,
    so a spelling registered against a host that never had it read as covered:
    four such pairs existed on the round-2 head, and ``desktop_lifecycle.py``
    was passing the check solely on ``child.remote``, a single site in the whole
    package. Per-pair counting also makes the DELETION of a whole ``_SCANNED``
    entry visible where the union could not see it — dropping the
    ``info/collect.py`` line removed its pair rather than emptying it, which is
    how the reviewer re-shipped the motivating outage (rename
    ``subagent_comms``, drop the exclusion entry it no longer backs) against a
    fully green guard.

    The scanned PATHS are pinned for the residue that per-pair counting still
    cannot reach: a deleted entry contributes no pair to check, so the pin is
    what converts "host silently removed" into a failure. The two assertions are
    complementary rather than redundant — the pin catches removing a host, the
    per-pair check catches a host that is still listed but no longer derives
    what it claims to.

    why it -- and not the viewer-only population pinned above -- is the right
    quantity beside the measurement. The two differ because this one counts
    inherited members; they answer different questions and must not be
    reconciled.
