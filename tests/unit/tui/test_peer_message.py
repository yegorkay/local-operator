"""TUI rendering of inbound peer messages (`lop send`).

Two delivery paths, mirroring the wake receipt: a LIVE delivery paints a
``PeerMessageBlock`` the instant the event lands, and a resumed conversation
REPLAYS a persisted ``peer_message`` custom row as the same block — without
double-painting one already shown live this session.

The block itself is a ledger CARD (``ExpandableActionBlock``), not the
rule-and-header block it started as. Cross-session traffic became routine
enough that a receipt printing its whole body cost 15 rows for one realistic
release-window announcement, and two of those pushed the conversation off
screen. ``TestPeerCard`` onward pins the card's contract: one row closed, the
sender named on it, full identity and full body on expand — and the sender
fields, which cross the wire from another process, still hardened exactly as
they were.
